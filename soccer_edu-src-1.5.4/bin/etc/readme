selected situation and the duration (repetiton period). Then click OK.

Start the server and then the teams. Teams will begin playing the game on
their own if the monitor does not connect to the server after a pre-defined

The latter feature is useful for evaluating the AI team by repeatedly
playing same situation, say the corner kick, attack on the goal, etc.
