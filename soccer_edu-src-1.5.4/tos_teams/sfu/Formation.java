 This class implements hard coded team formation.
 
 An alternative implementation is possible by manually placing players 
 on the field with the mouse in the Stepwise mode. Then this situation 
 can be saved to a file. This file could be loaded into this class. 
 
 Methods for saving game situation and loading it from file can be found
 in Soccer Monitor ( see SaveSnapshotAction, CoachLoadFileAction classes 
 in package soccer.client.action package and SituationDialog class in 
 soccer.client.dialog package)
