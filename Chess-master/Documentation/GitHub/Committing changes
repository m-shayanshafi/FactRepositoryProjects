You have now made some changes, and added some files, and you're ready to commit to your local repository. To perform a commit, right click on the file you wish to commit [or a folder - if you commit a folder, all files inside will be commited. Thus, committing the root directory will commit the whole project], find the Team sub menu, and select the Committ... option. Write a brief commit message explaining what you've changed or added since the last commit, and finish it.
