To add a new folder to the project, use the same operations you would normally - this is a normal Eclipse project. However, you will want to add these to the project itself on your repository. To do this, right click on the added file [you cannot do this to folders, but once you do it to a file in a folder, the folder will be added], find the Team sub menu from the right click menu, and select 'Add to version control.' Having done this, the file will be added the next time you perform a commit.
