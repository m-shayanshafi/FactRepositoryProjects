Whenever you start to code after a break, there's the possiblity that someone else has updated the remote repository, and your code is out of date. To make sure this doesn't happen, you should get in the habit of checking for updates whenever you start coding. It's fairly simple: right click your project directory, select the Team sub menu, and select the Fetch from... option. Use the default configured remote repository, and the default fetch specs. Hit next and finish, and the update will be performed.
