	<entry key="Title">Grand Source Spread (Cortese)</entry>
	<entry key="Description">"This is a good general-use spread for giving an overall
picture of the resolution to a problem in the past or future.  It
affords an opportunity to examine inner and outer influences before
an action is taken, the inception or motivation of the action, the
progression of the action, the resolution, and what inner and outer
effects this will have.  It may also act to highlight the process
by which a question uppermost in the querent's mind may be
answered, though it may not give the answer." - Cortese</entry>
