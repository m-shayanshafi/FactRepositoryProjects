		<entry key="ObjectTitle0">0-The Fool</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning0">You feel free from all worldly cares and responsibilities.  You are flowing freely with the stream of life. You are unified with God and His plan for you.  You might be feeling like you have tried everything and now you just "give up" and let God take over.  People around you might think you are irresponsible.  You might be acting so infantile that you are playing "the fool."</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle1">1-The Magician</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning1">You are experiencing a period of power, magic and impulisive activity.  You are so concentrated and active right now that miracles and magic seem to be a common occurance.  Now is a good time to start a new undertaking.  It might be wise to take a moment to look around you to see if you are hurting someone through either neglect or by directly walking over them.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle2">2-The High Priestess</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning2">Trust your intuition! It won't mislead you right now.   You "know" but may not understand how you "know."  You are experiencing intensive dreams and unexplainable feelings.  Let go of the intellect and reasoning for the moment and follow what you are feeling intuitively. You might need to use your intuition to help others as well.  People will listen to your advice even if it may not be logical advice.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle3">3-The Empress</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning3">You have reached a high point of emotional maturity in your life.  You are a central figure giving out unconditional love and emotional support to those around you.  You are in a phase of intensive creativity symbolized by the womb and childbirth.  If there are questions of health then childbirth or the reproductive organs are in focus.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle4">4-The Emperor</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning4">You are in a position of power and authority.   You have worked hard to get where you are and you are experiencing the culmination and possible end of a period in your life. People around you respect you and look up to you as thier protector and leader.  Don't dissapoint them!  Because you are nearing the end of a cycle, you might feel a little dissatisfaction and uneasiness even though you should be experienceing the best times in your life.  </entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle5">5-The Hierophant</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning5">Seek help.  You need perhaps professional help in the form of lawyers, doctors, bankers, counselors, priests or even highly respected friends.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle6">6-The Lovers</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning6">This card always refers to a very close relationship and it usually refers to a relationship that is sexual in nature.  This is a very positive card and the relationship will be very satisying and benificial to both persons.  If the relationship is not sexual then it is still a relationship with lots of deep love.  In very rare cases the card might refer to a deep passion one person has to an idea, hobby, work or way of life.  </entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle7">7-The Chariot</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning7">Stability and sacrifice are keywords.  You need to continue doing what you have started and don't change course or allow doubts to arise. People depend on you and you must not dissapoint them or yourself. Don't change anything!</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle8">8-Strength</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning8">You either are feeling very strong and courageous or you desperately need to start cultivating those qualities to deal with the present situation.  People around you will be inspired by your courage.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle9">9-The Hermit</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning9">Now is a time of reflection and solitude. You might need to rest and reflect on where you are going with your life.  People will see you as the "lonely wolf." You might be feeling very alone and "left out."  This might be a forced exile or a voluntary exile.  Either enjoy this period of isolation or actively seek to break out of it.  </entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle10">10-Wheel of Fortune</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning10">Right now, lady luck is on your side but you probably couldn't care less.  Miracles will happen but at the same time you don't place much importance on these miracles.  There is a certain transformation going on right now in your life which is raining gifts on you and giving you a feeling of understanding of the mysteries of life.  You see the great "circle of life" and feel how life is a continious wheel of birth and death.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle11">11-Justice</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning11">A fair and just solution will come to a situation or problem.  You and/or others will see clearly what has happened.  This is a period of reckoning and all the previously hidden or ignored details will come out for all to see.  Usually this card is positive for you but it might be negative for the other participant of the conflict.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle12">12-The hanged man</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning12">You must take a passive stance at this moment.  You cannot do anything actively to change the situation. Your hands are tied.  It is possible that you will enjoy this moment of passiveness and feel very close to God and the divine plan for you.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle13">13-Death</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning13">Don't misunderstand this card.  Tarot will almost never predict ones death.  This tells of a complete and total change of a situation.  What better symbol for this then "death?"  This change might be difficult to handle but if you show flexibility then this change will usually be greeted with joy in the end.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle14">14-Temperance</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning14">Now is not the time to go to extreams.  Take it easy.  Calm down.  Let life flow and let changes happen.  Small slight changes you make can have a large effect.  Very large efforts you make will probably have no effect at all.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle15">15-The Devil</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning15">You are forced to experience something that you may or may not find enjoyable.  Either way, you have no choice.  It will happen and it will usually happen in a big way.  This can sometimes refer to a relationship you feel unwillingly tied to or it can refer to a very intensive sexual relationship that you are enjoying tremendously.  There is no advice to give you here because the situation is predestined to happen and there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop it, speed it up, or slow it down.  Even if it is something very enjoyable, deep deep down there is an underlying pain that is slowly comming to the surface.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle16">16-The Tower</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning16">Thunder and lightening.  Something intensive and shocking will happen.  You will be totally unprepared.  This will result in a tremendous release of blocked energy.  After the shock is over you will usually be relieved like the calm after the storm.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle17">17-The Star</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning17">All your dreams are coming true.  Whatever you have hoped for is now a reality.  You are fealing elated.  You have a blissful smile on your face.  You feel totally satisifed.  There is nothing more to want at this moment.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle18">18-The Moon</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning18">You have no idea what is happening.  You probably feel that you know what is happening and feel that you have control over the situation but you are deluded.  It is not at all what you think it is.  Right now the smartest thing you can do is to hold your eyes wide open and absolutely make no long term plans, no deals and don't sign any contracts.  Just wait until the situation changes before taking any steps.  If you are forced to take action, then you have to accept the fact that you are acting blindly and will probably make a big mistake.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle19">19-The Sun</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning19">You feel happy and full of energy.  You are burning with enthusiasm and glowing with joy.  You are generously spreading this joy to everyone around you merely by your presence.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle20">20-Judgement</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning20">Now is the time to reap what you have sown.  You or someone must now pay for what they have done.  You cannot escape retribution.  This card is not necesarily negative but it rarely is pointing to a joyous outcome.  At best the outcome is neutral but most often someone will experience some pain when facing what they have done.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle21">21-The World</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning21">This is the last card in the higher arcana and thus represents total fullfillment.  You have reached total illumination.  The situation can not be better in any way, shape or form. The situation has reached its high point and you feel total fullfillment and perhaps the accompanyment of a feeling of oneness with the universe and God.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle22">Ace of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning22">You are intensively experienceing a new feeling or emotion.  A new enterprise is starting involving friends and loved ones.  It can mean the intensive begining of a new relationship.  You are feeling whole and healed and fully prepared to start a new adventure in the field of emotions, feelings and relationships.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle23">Two of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning23">There is a person you call your friend who means very much to you.  You enjoy this persons company greatly and always long to see them again. Nothing right now points to any type of a sexual relationship however, if the stars are willing, it might develop into one eventually.  Perhaps it already was at one time?  This might even be the friendship to an idea, hobby, work, or way of life.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle24">Three of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning24">You have reached a certain level of emotional security where you can freely love yourself and those around.  You enjoy company and may be looking forward to a party of some type.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle25">Four of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning25">You need time to reflect on what it is you feel and want.  You may need to withdraw and meditate a while.  You are experiencing a certain amount of emotional confusion and you look forward to some quiet time to sort things out.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle26">Five of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning26">You are feeling dissapointed with a person or a situation that is near to your heart.  Most likely, you are also being too demanding of the people around you.  This leads to a vicious cirlcle with you being even more dissapointed. Search deeply in yourself to try to find the true source of your sorrow. Perhaps you simply need to get some rest to regain your energy and then to once again be able radiate love to those around you.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle27">Six of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning27">You are feeling sentimental.  You are feeling love inside of yourself and you want to share that love with those around you in small ways.

		<entry key="ObjectTitle28">Seven of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning28">You are in the mood for experimenting with your feelings.  You want to try new relationships, experiences or friends.  You feel like you want to have some fun with something new and different.</entry>
		<entry key="ObjectTitle29">Eight of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning29">You need to take an accounting of who you refer to as friends, associates and/or lovers.

A vacation away from it all might be the answer to your problems.</entry>

		<entry key="ObjectTitle31">Ten of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning31">Your circle of friends and your family give you all that you need emotionally and you are a source of strength for them as well. Your happiness is complete.  But, because you have reached the end of a cycle, it might happen that there is a creeping feeling inside that tells you that now it is time to move on to new adventures and lessons.</entry>

		<entry key="ObjectTitle33">Knight of Cups</entry><entry key="ObjectMeaning33">The time for waiting, wondering or thinking is over.

You feel a tremendous amount of energy streaming through you right now to accomplish a task.  However, this is just the beginning.
