	<entry key="Title">Wish Spread (Doane)</entry>
	<entry key="Description">The nine of cups is often called the wish card.  If this card
should turn up anywhere in the reading, except in the group of three including card 8, this
would be a strong indication that some part or all of the querent's
wish will come true.  The closer it appears in the above numeric
sequence, the sooner the wish will be realized.  If the nine of
cups appears in group 8, this is an indication that the wish will
probably not come true; the other two cards in the group will yield
the cause.  If the nine of cups does not appear, this should not be
taken as an indication of either fate, although other cards in the
reading may confirm or deny the wish.</entry>
