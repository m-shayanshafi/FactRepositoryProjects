	<entry key="Title">Yes or No Spread (Peach)</entry>
	<entry key="Description">Peach suggests the cards be read in the following order:
               1+2, 3+4, 7+8, 5+6, 9+10  Note that 'helpful' and 'adverse' influences are always
with respect to the outcome shown in card 2.  Thus if the answer
comes up no, cards 3 and 4 will be aiding that outcome and not
necessarily aiding the querent.  Since Peach says that card If card 2 is upright, the answer to
          the question was yes; if reversed, no, then you probably should enable "allow reversed cards" </entry>
