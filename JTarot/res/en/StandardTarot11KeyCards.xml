	<entry key="Description">"Here's the Tarot layout I use, one I invented (as far
     as I know).  I developed the basics of the layout very soon
     after I became interested in the Tarot (I didn't think much of
     the standard ones), but I'm still working on it.  It's not
     meant to be primarily predictive.  Instead, it's intended to
     help the querent examine their question in a new light.  (For
     this reason, it's a reasonable layout for self-readings, if
     you do them.)  There are predictive elements, but I tend to
     use them rather broadly." - Efran</entry>

     interpretation will depend on the question, but the conflicts
     tend to be problems or obstacles the querent faces.  You may
     want to choose one option in a pair over the other, or attempt
     to reconcile the two, or simply recognize that a conflict
     exists.</entry>

	<entry key="PositionTitle9">Future</entry><entry key="Meaning9">Where things are headed.  This could be the 
     future if no action is taken, or the desired future, or the
     future if some specific action is taken.  You could try adding
     a card between 9 and 10 to represent the action or decision
     that will lead to card 10's future, or have several 'future'
     cards for various possible outcomes (two would be reasonable). 
     If you are comfortable with a single card 'prediction' of the
     future, the layout is probably ok as is.</entry>
	<entry key="PositionTitle10">Summaryt</entry><entry key="Meaning10">A summary of the reading, or a final comment on
     the situation, or advice, or a clarification of cards 8-10 if
     they are unclear.  I don't always use this card -- I have
     found that it generally doesn't clarify things much.  (See
     card 10 for other things to put here instead.)  I feel that
     there should be a card here, because then the layout is shaped
     roughly like a key (hence the name), which in my opinion looks
     cool.  I suspect the layout would look unbalanced without a
     card here. [ed. note: 'I' refers to Efran who made the layout]</entry>
