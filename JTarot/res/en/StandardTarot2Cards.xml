	<entry key="Title">Two cards</entry>
	<entry key="Description">Sometimes used as a yes/no answer or choosing the best of two situations.  Tarot is generally bad at yes/no answers but if you must ask one, this is one of the better layouts for it.  Choose in advance which card will be the "yes" card and which will be the "no" card or which situation which card will deal with.  Warning, sometimes the less desireable card is the best solution anyway! Sometimes you need to take the road less traveled.</entry>
