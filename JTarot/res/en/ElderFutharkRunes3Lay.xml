	<entry key="Title">Three Runes</entry>
	<entry key="Description">This is a simple past, present and future layout.  This layout is best to describe simple situations that don't really require a long and deep analysis.  Sometimes this is done before doing a more complicated layout in order to help you focus your ideas, feelings, or questions.  Also this can be done after a more complicated layout to further specify a specific question still remaining from the complex layout.</entry>
	<entry key="PositionTitle0">Past</entry><entry key="Meaning0">What has happened in the past.  What you already know.  What you are bringing with you into this problem.</entry>
	<entry key="PositionTitle1">Present</entry><entry key="Meaning1">Where you are now.  What you are feeling now.  What is happening to you now.</entry>
	<entry key="PositionTitle2">Future</entry><entry key="Meaning2">What is going to happen in the future.  Generally this is not the too distant future but the timeframe depends on the question.</entry>
