	<entry key="Title">Eliphas Levi Wheel Spread (Guiley)</entry>
	<entry key="Description">The layout is so named because it is based upon the
Eliphas Levi Wheel, a version of which is seen on Trump 10 in the
Rider-Waite deck; Levi did not invent this layout.  Levi's Wheel
assigned letters of the Tetragramaton (Yod, He, Vau, He,
respectively) to each of the four positions shown above.  Levi's
wheel also offers some additional interpretations of the four tarot
suits, the four ranks of court cards, and the meaning of the
letters T, O, R, and A.</entry>
