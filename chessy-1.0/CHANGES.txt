- Added file menu with Open option
- Altered class structure a bit
- Fixed mirrored-board bug (previously the board was displayed reversed, as 
  if you were looking from underneath the board, oops!, thanks Laura!)
- Added a paste dialog option in the file menu, so you can copy and paste
  the game history rather than saving to file first.
