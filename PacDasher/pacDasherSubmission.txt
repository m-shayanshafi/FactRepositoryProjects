PacDasher is a Pacman clone which seeks to exploit 
the new graphics capabilities and control over garbage collection 
included in Java 1.4 to show that Java is now a good choice
for creating arcade-style games.

The frame rate is 50fps with between 1000 and 2000 bytes 
put on the heap per frame. Many other Java games, especially 
applets, are prone to sudden freezes due to the garbage collection 
thread kicking in. With PacDasher, command-line options to 
Java specify the garbage collection algorithm used, and 
garbage collection is encouraged by the code at natural 
pauses in the game.

Unlike many other Pacman clones, PacDasher takes on the challenge
of giving a faithful representation of the maze in the original
1980 Pacman. There is also a second maze (from Ms. Pacman). 
Plans for future development include allowing mazes to be
created from XML (using JAXP or JDOM).
