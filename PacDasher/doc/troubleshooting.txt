Troubleshooting PacDasher
-------------------------


1. If, when running the run script, you get errors like ClassDefNotFoundError,
make sure your classpath does not contain anything that conflict with the
jars in the run script.


Reporting Issues
----------------

Mail code@oranda.com with a description of the problem. Attach the
pacdasher.log (in the same directory where you ran PacDasher). Tell
me the video card you are using, the speed of the machine, and any
other details you think might be relevant.
