      <pre>   Aladdin Free Public License<br>   (Version 7, June 4, 1998)<br>   <br>         Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998 Aladdin Enterprises,<br>            Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.<br>   <br>     NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the [1]GNU Licenses<br>     published by the [2]Free Software Foundation. Its terms are<br>     substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are<br>     familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra<br>     care.<br>     <br>   Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply<br>   this License to their own work, as long as the entire License<br>   (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no<br>   changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first<br>   paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work<br>   to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that<br>   holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied<br>   to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing<br>   the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the<br>   laws of the appropriate country.<br>   <br>0. Subject Matter<br><br>   This License applies to the computer program known as "PacDasher." <br>   The "Program", below, refers to such program. The Program <br>   is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by&nbsp;James McCabe <br>   (the "Licensor"). <br>   <br>   A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any<br>   derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States<br>   Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.<br>   <br>   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE<br>   PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND<br>   ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING<br>   THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE<br>   GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS<br>   DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT<br>   ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE<br>   PROGRAM. <br>   <br>1. Licenses.<br><br>   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you<br>   comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and<br>   provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this<br>   License with the Program:<br>   (a)<br>          You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of<br>          the Program's source code as you receive it throughout the<br>          world, in any medium.<br>   (b)<br>          You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program<br>          and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any<br>          medium.<br>          <br>2. Restrictions.<br><br>   This license is subject to the following restrictions:<br>   (a)<br>          Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by<br>          a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if<br>          any payment is made in connection with such distribution,<br>          whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or<br>          indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the<br>          Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a<br>          copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only examples,<br>          and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities).<br>          The following methods of distribution involving payment shall<br>          not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:<br>        (i)<br>               Posting the Program on a public access information storage<br>               and retrieval service for which a fee is received for<br>               retrieving information (such as an on-line service),<br>               provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the<br>               fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of<br>               information consisting of random data) and that access to<br>               the service and to the Program is available independent of<br>               any other product or service. An example of a service that<br>               does not fall under this section is an on-line service<br>               that is operated by a company and that is only available<br>               to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive<br>               enumeration.)<br>        (ii)<br>               Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable<br>               media, provided that the files containing the Program are<br>               reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all<br>               information on such media be redistributable for<br>               non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such<br>               media are distributed by themselves (except for<br>               accompanying documentation) independent of any other<br>               product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM,<br>               magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not<br>               intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a<br>               distribution that does not fall under this section is a<br>               CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an<br>               exhaustive enumeration.)<br>   (b)<br>          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of<br>          the Program are not subject to this License and they are<br>          outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is<br>          not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the<br>          Program is subject to this license only if its contents<br>          constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having<br>          been made by running the Program).<br>   (c)<br>          You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to<br>          any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in<br>          part contains or is derived from the Program or any part<br>          thereof ("the Work"):<br>        (i)<br>               If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work<br>               to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified<br>               the Program's files and the date of any change;<br>        (ii)<br>               You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at<br>               no charge to all third parties under the terms of this<br>               License;<br>        (iii)<br>               If the Work normally reads commands interactively when<br>               run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences<br>               operation, to print or display an announcement including<br>               an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is<br>               no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty).<br>               Such notice must also state that users may redistribute<br>               the Work only under the conditions of this License and<br>               tell the user how to view the copy of this License<br>               included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is<br>               interactive but normally prints or displays such an<br>               announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an<br>               "About box", the Work is required to print or display the<br>               notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program<br>               itself is interactive but does not normally print such an<br>               announcement, the Work is not required to print an<br>               announcement.);<br>        (iv)<br>               You must accompany the Work with the complete<br>               corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a<br>               medium customarily used for software interchange. The<br>               source code for a work means the preferred form of the<br>               work for making modifications to it. For an executable<br>               work, complete source code means all the source code for<br>               all modules it contains, plus any associated interface<br>               definition files, plus the scripts used to control<br>               compilation and installation of the executable code. If<br>               you distribute with the Work any component that is<br>               normally distributed (in either source or binary form)<br>               with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of<br>               the operating system on which the executable runs, you<br>               must also distribute the source code of that component if<br>               you have it and are allowed to do so;<br>        (v)<br>               If you distribute any written or printed material at all<br>               with the Work, such material must include either a written<br>               copy of this License, or a prominent written indication<br>               that the Work is covered by this License and written<br>               instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of<br>               the License on the distribution medium;<br>        (vi)<br>               You may not impose any further restrictions on the<br>               recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>          <br>   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the<br>   equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering<br>   equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts<br>   as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>   compelled to copy the source code along with the object code.<br>   <br>  3. Reservation of Rights.<br>  <br>   No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth<br>   herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the<br>   Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>   this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>   parties remain in full compliance.<br>   <br>  4. Other Restrictions.<br>  <br>   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain<br>   countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical<br>   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that<br>   distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>   written in the body of this License.<br>   <br>  5. Limitations.<br>  <br>   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO<br>   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT<br>   NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS<br>   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.<br>   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS<br>   WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>   <br>   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>   WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE<br>   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br>   ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT<br>   NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR<br>   LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM<br>   TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER<br>   PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br>   <br>  6. General.<br>  <br>   This License is governed by the laws of the State of Colorado,<br>   U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.<br>   <br>   If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,<br>   that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with<br>   the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.<br>   <br>   For United States Government users, the Program is provided with<br>   RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States<br>   Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency,<br>   the following apply:<br>   <br>     If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the<br>     Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial<br>     computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation"<br>     respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government<br>     is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with<br>     the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD,<br>     the Program and its documentation are classified as "commercial<br>     computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation"<br>     respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is<br>     acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the<br>     terms of this License.<br><br>References<br><br>   1. http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html<br>   2. http://www.gnu.org/<br></pre>
