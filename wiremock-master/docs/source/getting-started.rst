JUnit 4.x
=========
To use WireMock's fluent API add the following import:

.. code-block:: java

    import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock.*;

WireMock ships with some JUnit rules to manage the server's lifecycle and setup/tear-down tasks. To start and stop WireMock per-test case, add the following to your test class (or a superclass of it):

.. code-block:: java

    @Rule
    public WireMockRule wireMockRule = new WireMockRule(8089); // No-args constructor defaults to port 8080


Now you're ready to write a test case like this:

.. code-block:: java

    @Test
    public void exampleTest() {
        stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/my/resource"))
                .withHeader("Accept", equalTo("text/xml"))
                .willReturn(aResponse()
                    .withStatus(200)
                    .withHeader("Content-Type", "text/xml")
                    .withBody("<response>Some content</response>")));

        Result result = myHttpServiceCallingObject.doSomething();

        assertTrue(result.wasSuccessFul());

        verify(postRequestedFor(urlMatching("/my/resource/[a-z0-9]+"))
                .withRequestBody(matching(".*<message>1234</message>.*"))
                .withHeader("Content-Type", notMatching("application/json")));
    }

For many more examples of JUnit tests look no further than `WireMock's own acceptance tests <https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock>`_

For more details on verifying requests and stubbing responses, see :ref:`stubbing` and :ref:`verifying`

For more information on the JUnit rule see :ref:`junit-rule`.


Detailed configuration
======================

For a bit more control over the settings of the WireMock server created by the rule you can pass a fluently built
Options object to either (non-deprecated) rule's constructor:

.. code-block:: java

    import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.core.WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig;
    ...

    @Rule
    public WireMockRule wireMockRule = new WireMockRule(wireMockConfig().port(8089).httpsPort(8443));



Non-JUnit and general Java usage
================================

If you're not using JUnit or neither of the WireMock rules manage its lifecycle in a suitable way you can construct and start the
server directly:

.. code-block:: java

    WireMockServer wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(wireMockConfig().port(8089)); //No-args constructor will start on port 8080, no HTTPS
    wireMockServer.start();

    // Do some stuff

    WireMock.reset();

    // Finish doing stuff

    wireMockServer.stop();

If you've changed the port number and/or you're running the server on another host, you'll need to tell the client:

.. code-block:: java

    WireMock.configureFor("wiremock.host", 8089);

And if you've deployed it into a servlet container under a path other than root you'll need to set that too:

.. code-block:: java

    WireMock.configureFor("tomcat.host", 8080, "/wiremock");


Running standalone
==================

The WireMock server can be run in its own process, and configured via the Java API, JSON over HTTP or JSON files.

This will start the server on port 8080:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ java -jar wiremock-|version|-standalone.jar

You can `download the standalone JAR from here <http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/1.58/wiremock-1.58-standalone.jar>`_.

See :ref:`running-standalone` for more details and commandline options.


Fetching all of your stub mappings (and checking WireMock is working)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A GET request to the root admin URL e.g ``http://localhost:8080/__admin`` will return all currently registered stub mappings. This is a useful way to check
whether WireMock is running on the host and port you expect:



Deploying into a servlet container
==================================

WireMock can be packaged up as a WAR and deployed into a servlet container, with some caveats:
fault injection and browser proxying won't work, __files won't be treated as a docroot as with standalone,
the server cannot be remotely shutdown, and the container must be configured to explode the WAR on deployment.
This has only really been tested in Tomcat 6 and Jetty, so YMMV. Running standalone is definitely the preferred option.

The easiest way to create a WireMock WAR project is to clone the `sample app <https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock/tree/master/sample-war>`_

Deploying under a sub-path of the context root
----------------------------------------------
If you want WireMock's servlet to have a non-root path, the additional init param ``mappedUnder`` must be set with the sub-path
web.xml (in addition to configuring the servlet mapping appropriately).

See `the custom mapped WAR example <https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock/blob/master/sample-war/src/main/webappCustomMapping/WEB-INF/web.xml>`_ for details.
