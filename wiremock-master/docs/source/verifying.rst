    The WireMock server records all requests it receives in memory (at least until it is :ref:`stubbing-reset`). This makes it possible
    to verify that a request matching a specific pattern was received, and also to fetch the requests' details.


.. _verifying-checking-for-matching-requests:

Checking for matching requests
==============================


In Java
-------

To verify that a request matching some criteria was received by WireMock at least once:

.. code-block:: java

    verify(postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/verify/this"))
            .withHeader("Content-Type", equalTo("text/xml")));

The criteria part in the parameter to ``postRequestedFor()`` uses the same builder as for stubbing, so all of the same
predicates are available. See :ref:`stubbing` for more details.

To check for a precise number of requests matching the criteria, use this form:

.. code-block:: java

    verify(3, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/three/times")));


Via JSON + HTTP
---------------

There isn't a direct JSON equivalent to the above Java API. However, it's possible to achieve the same effect by requesting
a count of the number of requests matching the specified criteria (and in fact this is what the Java method does under the
hood).

This can be done by posting a JSON document containing the criteria to ``http://<host>:<port>/__admin/requests/count``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "/resource/to/count",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": {
                "matches": ".*/xml"
            }
        }
    }

A response of this form will be returned:

.. code-block:: javascript

    { "count": 4 }


Matching on header absence
--------------------------

When verifying (unlike stubbing) it is possible to specify that a particular header is not present:

.. code-block:: java

    verify(putRequestedFor(urlEqualTo("/without/header")).withoutHeader("Content-Type"));

Which is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "url" : "/without/header",
        "method" : "PUT",
        "headers" : {
            "Content-Type" : {
                "absent" : true
            }
        }
    }

.. _verifying-querying-request-details:

Querying request details
========================

It is also possible to retrieve the details of recorded requests. In Java this is done via a call to ``findAll()``:

.. code-block:: java

    List<LoggedRequest> requests = findAll(putRequestedFor(urlMatching("/api/.*")));


And in JSON + HTTP by posting a criteria document (of the same form as for request counting) to
``http://<host>:<port>/__admin/requests/find``, which will return a response like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "requests": [
        {
          "url": "/my/url",
          "absoluteUrl": "http://mydomain.com/my/url",
          "method": "GET",
          "headers": {
            "Accept-Language": "en-us,en;q=0.5",
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:9.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0",
            "Accept": "image/png,image/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.5"
          },
          "body": "",
          "browserProxyRequest": true,
          "loggedDate": 1339083581823,
          "loggedDateString": "2012-06-07 16:39:41"
        },
        {
          "url": "/my/other/url",
          "absoluteUrl": "http://my.other.domain.com/my/other/url",
          "method": "POST",
          "headers": {
            "Accept": "text/plain",
            "Content-Type": "text/plain"
          },
          "body": "My text",
          "browserProxyRequest": false,
          "loggedDate": 1339083581823,
          "loggedDateString": "2012-06-07 16:39:41"
        }
      ]
    }


Listening for requests
======================

If you're using the JUnit rule or you've started ``WireMockServer`` programmatically, you can register listeners to be
called when a request is received.

e.g. with the JUnit rule:

.. code-block:: java

    List<Request> requests = new ArrayList<Request>();
    rule.addMockServiceRequestListener(new RequestListener() {
         @Override
         public void requestReceived(Request request, Response response) {
             requests.add(LoggedRequest.createFrom(request));
         }
    });

    for (Request request: requests) {
        assertThat(request.getUrl(), containsString("docId=92837592847"));
    }

Reset
=====

The request log can be reset at any time. If you're using either of the
JUnit rules this will happen automatically at the start of every test case. However you can do it yourself
via a call to ``WireMock.resetAllRequests()`` in Java or posting a request with an empty body to ``http://<host>:<port>/__admin/requests/reset``.
