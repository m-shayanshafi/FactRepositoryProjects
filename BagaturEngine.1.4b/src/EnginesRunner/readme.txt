For the latest and greatest version of this readme file you can visit the SVN repository and check the EnginesRunner sub-project:
SVN repository https://bagaturchess.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bagaturchess


This sub-project contains a main method which runs the Bagatur searcher without involving the UCI related components.
It is very appropriate sample reference if you plan to play with the Bagatur's searchers, configurations and/or evaluation functions
or you want to program such artifacts by yourself.


Have a nice usage ... and feel free to contribute http://sourceforge.net/projects/bagaturchess/develop
