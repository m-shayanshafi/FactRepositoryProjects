Building: 
	
To build this software, the following packages are required:
	
 1) The Sun Wireless Toolkit

	http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/
		
 2) Apache Ant
		 
 	http://ant.apache.org/
		
 3) Antenna - J2ME ant tasks
		
	http://antenna.sourceforge.net/
			
 4) Proguard - Java obfuscation
		
	http://proguard.sourceforge.net/
			
Once these packages are installed update the build.system.properties file to include the appropriate paths.
	
Building is accomplished by using running ant in the project directory with project-specific ant targets. When in the project roon, type "ant help" to get a list of available targets.
	
A summary of the main ant targets follows:

Build target - builds project classes in build/classes directory:
	
	ant build
		
Package target - creates .jar and .jad files in the build/jar directory
	
	ant package
		
Javadoc target - creates javadoc in the docs/javadoc directory
		
	ant javadoc
