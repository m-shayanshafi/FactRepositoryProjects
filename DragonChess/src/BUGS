BUGS
----

We have released the game as soon as it was playable, so there's still plenty
of bugs :

o Resize bug (654606): pieces don't resize correctly when window is resized. 
  In fact the resizing is one step behind. 
	Workaround : resize the window again just a little bit. The resize will
	catch up and show about the right piece size
o next game bug : a new game doesn't start automatically when choosing 'play
  another game' even when 2 players are registered.
o Timer does not control anything
o Load Game/Save Game don't work
o Offer Draw isn't implemented yet
o Spectator mode not implemented yet

... probably a lot more. Find any ? Please file a bug at
