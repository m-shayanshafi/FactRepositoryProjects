CONTENTS

Only the source files (Java Files).


IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

  This project is CLOSED. It means that I do not intend
  to correct any line of code in it... for now. If you take a look
  at the source you will probably find nasty things... Well,
  I have spent some time on this code and know where my mistakes are...
  BUT your advice can be VERY precious. SO, if you find things to change
  in the code inform me (lenistour@netcourrier.com). If I receive numerous critics
  I will create a THINGS-TO-CHANGE list on this site so everyone can see what
  has been found. And you never know... perhaps one day I will find time
  to consider a VideoToons v2.
  
  Also, I have not made lots of docs about the game architecture... if you find
  things you don't understand mail me !


INSTALLATION
------------

Well, you can compile this code with "java videotoons/game/VideoToons.java"
But you won't be able to play...

Download the devel package !
