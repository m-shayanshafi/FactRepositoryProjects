SERVER INSTALLATION:
to run the scorch server you will need two JAR files:
Scorch.jar and ScorchServer.jar
On Windows run the rs.bat file. On Unix run rs (or rs.kaffe if you use
kaffe) script. You may need to edit those scripts to supply correct paths.
For the best results on FreeBSD and Linux use kaffe 1.0.5

After the server is running, you can play on the same computer but just
opening 800x600.html or 1024x768.html locally with either appletviewer or 
browser. If you want to allow other people use your server you will need a
web server running on this machine. Please note that web server must run
on the same machine where ScorchServer runs. Java Applets can connect only
to the host which served the html files.
