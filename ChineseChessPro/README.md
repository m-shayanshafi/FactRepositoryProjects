This is a Chinese chess program written by me a year ago to stimulate a 'smart' computer robot to play the Chinese chess game with us.  The computer robot is programmed with its artificial intelligence (i.e. A.I.) system to make a chess move against us.  The A.I. is basically implemented as a scoring system in which each possible chess move has its score based on how many enemy chess it can kill and/or the number of enemy chess left...etc.  

Some of the screen shots of this game can be seen in the screenshots folder.
 
To run the program, download the ChineseChessPro-v{$version}.jar file and issue this command :   
java -cp ChineseChessPro-v{$version}.jar kw.chinesechess.board.ChineseChess 

-> The improvement-wish-list in the future: better A.I. algorithm, better GUI interface, implement a 'SAVE' and 'UNDO' functionalities.

**Note: in order to protect the copyright, I have taken out all the *.java source files inside the kw.chinesechess.engine package.  Any serious inquirer can contact me for the whole source code.
