WARNING
=======

Server operators may insist that Napsack is a "bot" and may subsequently
ban you from their servers for using Napsack.  Note that if you are banned
from a server for using Napsack, it is neither the server operator's problem
nor mine.  As many server operators will tell you, connecting to their servers
is a privilege, not a right.
