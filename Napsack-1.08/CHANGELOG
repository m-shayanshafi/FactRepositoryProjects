CHANGELOG
=========

11 February 2002
----------------
* Updated Napsack to correctly read the server list from
  client1.napigator.com/servers.php; any server files used through the
  servers_file property, should be in the same format as the list available at
  client1.napigator.com/servers.php from now on.
* Fixed a couple of bugs that led to incorrect reporting in the Problems
  dialog.
* Fixed a bug that caused search results to be misplaced within the results
  tree.
* Changed the servers_file property so that it specifies a servers file to use,
  instead of just toggling the use of the .napsack_servers file. 
* Updated copyright information to include 2002.

7 December 2001
---------------
* Divided error messages into two classes:  those related to search setup, and
  those related to the execution of a command on a particular server.  This
  distinction changes how error messages are displayed and controlled:
  * The classic client prints both setup and command error messages to stderr,
    as before.  The error_messages propterty controls the printing of setup and
    command error messages when using the classic client, also as before.
  * The GUI client displays each setup error message in a separate warning
    dialog, as before, but now displays all command error messages together
    in a Problems dialog.  The error_messages property only controls
    the display of setup error messages when using the GUI client--command
    errors are always added to the Problems dialog.
  * Command errors include more information about the error encountered,
    including server replies (in most cases). 
* Added a "Flip results tree" option to the View menu.  This option re-
  orients the results tree, so that results are grouped first by service and
  then by query.  By default, results are grouped first by query and then by
  service.
* Changed the organization of services returned from www.napigator.com.  Now,
  many single servers are considered part of a network.  This affects the
  way that results are shown: a lone server's network name now appears in
  the results tree.  Only servers that have their network specified as n/a
  by Napigator are still treated as stand-alone servers.
* Added a application_identifier property.  This property is sent to each
  Napster server upon connection.  It is used by a server to identify the type
  of client that is connecting to it.
* Updated SongQueryResultFormat so that NapsterNetworks are printed to the
  console as they are displayed in the gui--<network> (<ip>:<port>).
* Updated AboutDialog to use setVisible instead of show and hide.
* Removed main_location and main_size properties.  These two metrics were
  not being handled uniformly across various JVM implementations.
* Cleanup.
  
20 August 2001
--------------
* Fixed a bug in the main_location property.  This property should now work
  correctly on desktops with multiple viewports and, er, desktops.

13 May 2001
-----------
* Added a command_attempts property and a command_attempt_interval propery
  to the .napsack properties file.  These properties control how Napsack
  retries failed queries (due to full servers, communication problems,
  network errors, etc...).
* Added a main_size property and a main_location property to specify the
  size and location of the main Napsack window.

03 April 2001
-------------
* Right-aligned numerical values in graphical search-result columns.
* Added a servers_file property that allows Napsack to read Napigator data
  from a file.
* Re-implemented the search engine to support cancelling and event
  notification.
* Added a status bar.
* Added a progress bar.

06 March 2001
-------------
* Added a Save Settings item to the File menu.  This allows a user to
  save application settings at any time.
* Added a Help menu with an About dialog.
* Added a graphical login dialog.

13 February 2001
----------------
* Changed the Max. Results field from a text-entry box to a slider.
* Changed the Bit Rate and Frequency fields from text-entry boxes to combo
  boxes.
* Added keyboard mnemonics to all of the search fields.
* Changed the default height of the Query Strings and the Excluded Networks
  lists.
* Removed the grid lines from the results table.
* Added a save_on_exit property to save Napsack properties changed through
  the GUI.  save_on_exit=Off by default.
* Added a shutdown hook to (optionally) save properties on exit.
* Added a menu bar.
* Changed the search panel to lazily initialize the Networks tab.
* Added sorting capability to the GUI.  Sorting can be initiated by selecting
  an entry from the View > Sort By menu, or by clicking on a column header.
* Modified the sort_by property to recognize a "-" reverse-sort-order modifier
  in the case of a single sorting field.  This modification allows Napsack to
  remember GUI initiated sorting between invocations.
* Added a View > Show menu to select visible results columns.

13 January 2001 - 1.01
----------------------
* 1.01 marks the first iteration in the development of Napsack 2.0, a graphical
  Napsack.
* The GUI is now (barely) functional, and presents one search per application
  invocation.  To launch a second search, close and re-launch Napsack.  Fixing
  this is first on the list for 1.02.
* Added a gui property to toggle between graphical and classic console
  output.  gui=On by default.
* Added a table_columns property to select the columns that are visible in
  the GUI's search-results table.
* Fixed a bug that caused a NullPointerException whenever connection type
  was included in the output_format property.
* Introduced some incompatibilities into ~/.napsack for consistency (among
  1.01 properties) and correctness.  In particular:
  * The query property has been renamed to queries.
  * The line_speed property has been renamed to connection.
  * The second and minute values are no longer valid for the sort_by or
    output_format properties.  The Length value can be used instead:  it
    represents a song's total length (in seconds) to sort_by, and it represents
    a string in #00:00 format to output_format.
  * The connection type value for the sort_by and output_field properties has
    been renamed to Connection.
  * The values for the connection property (previously line_speed; see above)
    that ended in Kb now end in Kbps.
  * All property values have been converted to title case.  For exampe, equal
    to is now Equal To.
* Cleanup.

12 December 2000 - 1.0
----------------------
* Fixed a bug that caused a query to fail on all servers in a Napster
  network.  This behaviour occurred whenever a query failed after
  (as opposed to during) server login.
* Minor cleanup.

21 November 2000 - 0.04b
------------------------
* Fixed a bug that crashed Napsack on startup.  The crash occurred whenever
  delimiter--along with at least one of nick, password, and query--was not
  specified in ~/.napsack.

21 November 2000 - 0.03b
------------------------
* Fixed a bug that caused an IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown when a
  backslash appeared in a user's nick (in a search result).
* Search results may now be formatted.  Each song property, as well as the
  Napster-service identifier, may appear left-justified, right-justified,
  centered, or right-justified (zero padded).  An output format may be
  specified via the output_format property in the .napsack properties file.
* Added a sorting feature.  By specifying fields through the sort_by property
  in the properties file, results from each query on each Napster service
  may be sorted.  A field may be used as a sorting criterion without appearing
  in the output.
* Error messages may be suppressed by specifying error_messages=off in
  .napsack.

16 September 2000 - 0.02
------------------------
* Fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException bug.
* Fixed an interleaved-results-output (results from multiple servers
  were mixed together upon output) bug.
* Added nine recognized properties--excluded-networks, min_users, min_files,
  min_gigs, bit_rate, frequency, line_speed, max_threads, and delimiter--to the
  .napsack properties file, and expanded a previously recognized property--
  query.
* The query property may now contain a list of queries to launch.  A list of
  queries may also be specified on the command-line.  In the case that query
  is specified both in .napsack and on the command line, the command-line
  queries are appended to those queries that appear in .napsack.
 
04 September 2000 - 0.01
------------------------
Initial release, alpha stage.
