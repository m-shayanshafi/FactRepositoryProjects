Special Notes
-------------
* The use of the servers_file property has changed, along with the recognized
  format for a servers file.  See PROPERTIES and CHANGELOG for more
  information.
* main_size and main_location are no longer recognized, so they should be
  removed from ~/.napsack.
* The default value for error_messages has changed from On to Off.
* Napsack now requires Java 1.3.  See src/napsack/gui/MainFrame.java,
  /src/napsack/gu/MainFrameListener.java, and
  /src/napsack/gui/results/ResultsTable.java for instructions on back-porting
  Napsack to Java 1.2.2.
* The format of the .napsack properties file has changed.  See PROPERTIES, or
  the February 17 entry in CHANGELOG for details.
