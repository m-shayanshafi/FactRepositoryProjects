.SH "DESCRIPTION"



.PP
Simple text based interface to Go programs supporting the Go Text Protocol\&. It keeps track of the board and prints it after each change on the board\&. If a move (coordinate on the board or pass) is entered, it is played on the board for the color to move, followed by a \fBgenmove\fR command sent to the program\&. Other supported commands are:


.TP
\fBgenmove\fR
Send a \fBgenmove\fR command for the color to move to the program\&.

.TP
\fBhelp\fR
Print help\&.

.TP
\fBlist\fR
Send a \fBlist_commands\fR command to the program\&.

.TP
\fBload\fR
Load game from a SGF file\&. Moves are translated into \fBplay\fR commands for the program\&.

.TP
\fBnewgame [size]\fR
Start a new game with a given board size\&.

.TP
\fBsave\fR
Save game to file in SGF format\&.

.TP
\fBundo\fR
Send a \fBundo\fR command to the program\&.

.TP
\fBquit\fR
Terminate program and exit\&.


.PP
GTP commands that change the board state are not allowed\&. Other GTP commands are forwarded to the program\&.


.SH "OPTIONS"



.TP
\fB\-config\fR \fIfile\fR
Read command line options and arguments from the given file\&.

.TP
\fB\-size\fR \fIn\fR
Board size\&.

.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR
Log GTP stream to standard error\&.

.TP
\fB\-version\fR
Print version and exit\&.
