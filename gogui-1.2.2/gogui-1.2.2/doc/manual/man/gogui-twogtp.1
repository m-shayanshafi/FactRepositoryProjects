.SH "DESCRIPTION"



.PP
Adapter program for playing games between two Go programs supporting GTP (Go Text Protocol)\&.



.PP
Optional observer and referee GTP Go programs can be used for observing the game and answering commands related to the final game score\&. TwoGtp forwards the following commands to all programs (command translation is done for protocol version 1 programs): 

.TP 3
\(bu
\fBboardsize\fR
.TP
\(bu
\fBclear_board\fR
.TP
\(bu
\fBkomi\fR (if supported)
.TP
\(bu
\fBplay\fR
.TP
\(bu
\fBquit\fR
.TP
\(bu
\fBscoring_system\fR (if supported)
.TP
\(bu
\fBtime_settings\fR (if supported)
.TP
\(bu
\fBundo\fR
.LP
 The following commands are forwarded to the referee program, if existing, otherwise to first player program that implements them (Black is tried first): 

.TP 3
\(bu
\fBfinal_score\fR
.TP
\(bu
\fBfinal_status\fR
.TP
\(bu
\fBfinal_status_list\fR
.LP
 The command \fBgenmove\fR is forwarded only to the program of the corresponding color, the other programs are informed about the move with a \fBplay\fR command\&. GTP extension commands implemented by exactly one of the programs are forwarded to the program\&. The special comment line \fB#\~interrupt\fR, used by GoGui to interrupt commands, is forwarded to all programs\&.



.PP
If the option \fB\-sgffile\fR is used, the games are saved after they are finished and a result text file in table format is created with some statistics\&. If the program(s) support the GTP command \fBcputime\fR, these statistics include CPU times\&. The errors in the statistics are the standard errors (confidence interval 68%)\&. They are computed by the standard deviation of the results, divided by the square root of the number of unique games, which is correct only for a sufficiently large number of games (especially if the percentage of wins is close to 0% or 100%)\&.


.SH "OPTIONS"



.TP
\fB\-alternate\fR
Alternate colors\&. Black and White are exchanged every odd game; the scores saved in the results table \fB\-sgffile\fR are still using the name Black and White, as given with \fB\-black\fR and \fB\-white\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-analyze\fR \fIfile\&.dat\fR
Analyze the result file \fI\fIfile\&.dat\fR\fR\&. Creates a HTML file \fI\fIfile\&.html\fR\fR with links to the games and summary statistics\&. Also creates a text file \fI\fIfile\&.summary\&.dat\fR\fR, with a table row containing the most important summary statistics\&.

.TP
\fB\-auto\fR
Automatically play games\&. Use this option if you want to run TwoGtp as a standalone program, without a program like GoGui which controls the move generation with \fBgenmove\fR commands\&. If a result file already exists (as specified with \fB\-sgffile\fR), and contains less games than specified with \fB\-games\fR, the remaining games will be played\&. Use \fB\-force\fR to overwrite existing result files\&.

.TP
\fB\-black\fR \fIcommand\fR
Command for the black program\&.

.TP
\fB\-compare\fR
Compare a list of SGF files given as arguments an exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-config\fR \fIfile\fR
Read command line options and arguments from the given file\&.

.TP
\fB\-force\fR
Overwrite existing files\&.

.TP
\fB\-games\fR \fIn\fR
Number of games to play (0 means no limit)\&.

.TP
\fB\-help\fR
Display help and exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-komi\fR \fIkomi\fR
Komi\&. If this option is not used, a default komi of 6\&.5 will be used\&. The komi cannot be changed at runtime\&. The \fBkomi\fR GTP command will succeed, if the argument has the same value as the configured komi and fail otherwise\&.

.TP
\fB\-maxmoves\fR \fIn\fR
Limit the maximum number of moves\&. Can be useful if some games would not terminate otherwise\&. Default is 1000\&. \-1 means no limit\&.

.TP
\fB\-observer\fR \fIcommand\fR
Command for the observer program\&.

.TP
\fB\-openings\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Use openings from SGF files in the given directory\&. The openings will be cycled through in alphabetical order\&. If option \fB\-alternate\fR is set, each opening is played twice with colors exchanged\&. If TwoGtp is used as a GTP engine, the opening moves will be returned to the controller as responses to the first \fBgenmove\fR GTP commands\&. Note that in this case opening files with non\-alternating moves or setup stones are not supported (this is currently not checked and will result in undefined behavior)\&. In automatic mode (see \fB\-auto\fR), there is no such restriction\&.

.TP
\fB\-referee\fR \fIcommand\fR
Command for the referee program\&.

.TP
\fB\-sgffile\fR \fIprefix\fR
Save games after they are finished with filename \fI \fIprefix\fR\-\fIn\fR\&.sgf \fR (\fIn\fR is the game number)\&. The results are appended to the file \fI\fIprefix\fR\&.dat\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-size\fR \fIn\fR
Board size for games\&. If this option is not used, the size will be set with the \fBboardsize\fR command, or the default size 19 will be used when option \fB\-auto\fR is set\&.

.TP
\fB\-time\fR \fItimespec\fR
Set time limits (basetime[+overtime/moves])\&. The base time and overtime (byoyomi) can have an optional unit specifier (m or min for minutes; s or sec for seconds; default is minutes)\&.

.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR
Print debugging messages\&.

.TP
\fB\-version\fR
Print version and exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-white\fR \fIcommand\fR
Command for the white program\&.

.TP
\fB\-xml\fR
Save games in XML format\&.


.SH "GTP EXTENSIONS"



.PP
 

.TP
\fBgogui\-interrupt\fR
Indicate interrupt ability for GoGui\&. TwoGtp will forward the interrupt to both programs, with the appropriate method, if they implement either \fBgogui\-interrupt\fR or \fBgogui\-sigint\fR\&. See the chapter "Interrupting Commands" in the GoGui documentation\&.

.TP
\fBgogui\-title\fR
Return a title for the current game, consisting of the game number (if option \fB\-sgffile\fR was used) and the player names\&.

.TP
\fBgogui\-twogtp\-black \fIcommand\fR\fR
Send command to the black player\&.

.TP
\fBgogui\-twogtp\-observer \fIcommand\fR\fR
Send command to the observer program\&.

.TP
\fBgogui\-twogtp\-referee \fIcommand\fR\fR
Send command to the referee program\&.

.TP
\fBgogui\-twogtp\-white \fIcommand\fR\fR
Send command to the white player\&.
