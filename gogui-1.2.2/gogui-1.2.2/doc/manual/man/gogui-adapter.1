.SH "DESCRIPTION"



.PP
Go Text Protocol adapter for logging or protocol translations\&. The argument \fIprogram\fR is a command line for the Go program \&.


.PP
The adapter keeps its own board state and handles all commands that change the board state by translating them into appropriate commands for the actual Go engine\&. This can be used to do GTP protocol translations between version 1 and version 2 controllers and engines, or for emulating commands that the engine does not support\&. For instance, if the engine does not support \fBundo\fR, the adapter will send a clear board command followed by a sequence of moves up to the previous position\&. The command \fBloadsgf\fR is always handled by the adapter and translated into a sequence of \fBplay\fR commands (or \fBgogui\-setup\fR, if supported by the program)\&. The command is also registered as \fBloadxml\fR and is able to handle file arguments that are in Jago's XML format\&.


.SH "OPTIONS"



.TP
\fB\-config\fR \fIfile\fR
Read command line options and arguments from the given file\&.

.TP
\fB\-fillpasses\fR
Fill non\-alternating moves with pass moves (for programs that can only handle move sequences with alternating color)\&.

.TP
\fB\-gtpfile\fR \fIfile\fR
Send GTP commands from file to program at startup\&. The file may not contain commands that change the board state\&.

.TP
\fB\-help\fR
Display help and exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-log\fR \fIfile\fR
Log the GTP stream to a file (the stream of the adapter program, not the one from the adapter to the Go program)\&.

.TP
\fB\-lowercase\fR
Translate move commands to lower\-case\&. The GTP standards requires case\-insensitive parsing of moves, but some programs can handle only lower\-case\&.

.TP
\fB\-name\fR \fIname\fR
Name used for answering the \fBname\fR command\&. If the name contains a colon, the part after the colon is interpreted as a version and used for answering the \fBversion\fR command\&.

.TP
\fB\-noscore\fR
Hide the \fBfinal_score\fR and \fBfinal_status_list\fR commands, even if the program supports them\&.

.TP
\fB\-size\fR \fIn\fR
Board size at startup\&. Default is 19\&.

.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR
Print the GTP stream from the adapter to the Go program to standard error\&.

.TP
\fB\-version\fR
Print version and exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-version1\fR
Sets, whether gogui\-adapter reports protocol version 1 in response to the \fBprotocol_version\fR command and implements version 1 commands\&.


.SH "GTP EXTENSIONS"



.PP
 

.TP
\fBgogui\-adapter\-showboard\fR
Show the internal Go board\&. This is different from the \fBshowboard\fR command, which is forwarded to the Go program, if it supports it\&.
