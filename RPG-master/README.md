A 2D Legend of Zelda like RPG written using Java and LibGDX.

[Introduction and Credits]

This RPG uses a tile map built via Tiled (http://www.mapeditor.org/), a tileset and sprites 
by Little Workshop (http://www.littleworkshop.fr/) created for Mozilla's 
BrowserQuest (https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest), and the LibGDX Java game development 
framework (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). 

The game began as a modification of Super Koalio, a LibGDX demo created by Mario Zechner
(https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/superkoalio).
