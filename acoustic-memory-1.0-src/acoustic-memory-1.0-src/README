DESCRIPTION
===========
Acoustic-Memory is a memory game with sound.
The goal of the game is to find all pairs of cards with the same sound.



LICENSE
======= 
This program is distributed under the term of GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
For details see COPYING file.



PREREQUISITES
=============
A Java Runtime Environment is needed to run the program.
A free download for your platform is available from http://www.java.com.
At least a JRE version 5.0 is required.



SOUNDS
======
There are no sounds provided with the game, so you must use your own sound.
Place them in the sound directory or configure the path to your sound directory
in the game preferences.
You can only use sounds that can be played by the Java Sound API (mainly 
standard .wav files).



STARTING
========
The program consists of a single .jar file: Acoustic-Memory-<version>.jar
(replace <version> with the appropriate version of the game).

If jar files are associated with java (like on MS-Windows), the program can be
started by doubleclicking it.
Alternatively, you can type the following at a command line console:
  java -jar Acoustic-Memory-<version>.jar



GUI
===
The game provides to equivalent GUI implementation. One implemententation uses a
SWT gui, the other a Swing GUI.
The SWT GUI requires additional libraries. For details and downloads see 
http://www.eclipse.org/swt.
The Swing GUI comes with the default library from SUN but may not run with free
Java virtual machines.

The game will first try to create a SWT GUI. If it fails (e.g. because SWT is
not installed), the game will create the Swing GUI.

You can also explicitly control, which GUI to create by setting the 
"acoustic-memory.gui" property. If it set to "swt" the SWT GUI will be created, 
if it is set to "swing", the Swing GUI will be created.

Examples:
  SWT:
    java -cp <path to your>/swt.jar -Dacoustic-memory.gui=swt 
      -Djava.library.path=<path to your>/<swt library> 
      -jar acoustic-memory-0.2.jar
  
  Swing:
    java -Dacoustic-memory.gui=swing -jar acoustic-memory-<version>.jar



CONFIGURATION
=============
In the preferences dialog the size of the field and the directory containing
the sound files can be selected.
The program will only accept sound files that can be read by the Java sound API.
Note that there will only be displayd a maximum number of cards limited by the 
available sound files.
In order a changed configuration to take effect a new game must be started.
