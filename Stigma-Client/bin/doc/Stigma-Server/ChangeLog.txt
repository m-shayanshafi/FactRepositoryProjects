    * Support for picking up, dropping and equipping items.
    * (#182) Changed login procedure - other actors/clients of same player will be disconnected just after acceptance of password (was: after choosing new actor)
    * (#91) Server sends information about available player's actors safe map id.
    * (#73) Server can have its own HTTP inner server for distributing resources to clients (with automatic compression as option).

    * (#52) 'Connection timed out' detection added.
    * (#52) Special time-outs for authorization process and limited authorization process pool added (both parameters configurable).

    * (#148) Overcumbered actor will not be allowed to move.  
    * Items support added (data structures, managers etc.)    
    * Pseudo AI fix - NPCs moves should be more random. 
    * Updated distributed MySQL JDBC connector package from 5.1.7 to 5.1.8.
    * Updated distributed SQLiteJDBC package from v054 to v056.
    * I18n utility moved to separate project (i18n4j) and re-attached to Stigma as external library.
    * Configurable server main network port.
    - Renamed packages to pl.minions.org.* - now they match existing domain.
    - (#97) 'resource.properties' renamed to 'resourceset.stigmares' - custom file extension will allow some application assignments in OS in future.  
    - (#118) 'Time-stamp' protocol implemented for items (items data synchronization client-server).
    - (#82) Server sends resistances of player's actors.
    - (#132) WorldManager will try to respect actor's map instance when "addActor" is called.
    - AllClassesLoader added to i18n tool - no more "static registering" of classes needed.
    - Single Commands wrapping class split to many packages.
    - Single Deltas wrapping class split to many packages. Separate package delta created.
    - Single NetworkMessage wrapping class split to many packages.
    - Great re-factoring - Deltas split to Events and WorldData. Changed interpretation of Events - more descriptive, less general.
    - 'Time-stamp' protocol refactored to be more generic.
    - 'Ping' message added. Server will automatically re-send them. Client can process them.
    - Removed 'cleaningThread' from LoggedPlayersCache - GlobalTimer used instead.
    - Created SystemMessage class for transporting different events to player.
    - AiManagerQueue generalized into TurnScheduleQueue.
    - Changed login sequence - now client has 'time' to download some data before receiving available actors list.
    
Fixes:
    * Changed tests actors properties to be more "different" inside one account.
    * While saving archetypes are subtracted properly from actor.
    * While adding/subtracting archetypes resistances are calculated properly.
    * (#99) When missing translated string i18n utility will no longer crash application.
    * (#107) Newly logged player's actor didn't have actual stamina level restored.
    * AI will no longer calculate "move timeout" - less probability of NPC trying to move to soon.
    * (#110) Player receive archetypes of his actors when logging in.



Server 0.3.0 - 2009/07/01
----------------------------------

Features:
    * XML resources will be verified against schemas provided in res/metadata/xsd directory.
    * (#30) MapType has a one-to-one association with StaticNpcs, other ways to generate NPCs will be made in future.
    * (#16) 'Archetype engine' added - each actor can be build from archetypes and every archetype can be build from other archetypes.
    * (#36) NPC description uses 'archetype engine' so NPCs can be composed from various archetypes.
    * (#39) 'Safe' maps added - player actors are saved only on certain maps; on login the actors are spawned inside a 'safe entry zone' defined in the last visited 'safe' map. 
    * "Disconnected player's actors reconnect grace period" added to server configuration.
    * Disconnected (brutally, not by logout) player's actor will be available for >at least< "grace period".
    * (#41) Periodical 'world saves' added - every few (configurable) minutes all players' actors are stored in the database.
    * (#46) Authentication moved to a separate thread - less chance of "blocking lag".
    * (#37) Created some stubs for calculating actor dynamic characteristics (ActorCalculator class).
    * (#38) Server allows to log out player actors - logging out will save the actor but disallow logging in with the same actor for some time.
    * (#53) Server allows refreshing list of currently disabled actors when client is in 'choose actor' login state.
    * "Kill" option added to tray menu.
    * (#65) Server version available in tray icon tool tip.

    - UserDB renamed to PlayerLoadDB.
    - LogonDB renamed to LoggedPlayersCache.
    - LoginState enum values changed to UPPER_CASE.
