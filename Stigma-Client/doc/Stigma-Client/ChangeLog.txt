Fixes:
    * All resources (XML, images) are now loaded using hexadecimal numbers.
    * Major performance boost with new mechanism for loading and caching images.

    * Improved performance by disabling composition buffers in segment widgets.
    
    

Client 0.1.0 - 2008/11/16
----------------------------------

    * Establishing and reestablishing connection to server.
    * Security keys exchange with the server.
    * Logging to the server using any registered account.
    * Choosing an 'actor' from available to logged in user.
    * Error detection and handling during login (bad client version, bad user name/password etc.)

    * Map loading and rendering.
    * Navigation on map using keyboard (to be removed in future versions).
