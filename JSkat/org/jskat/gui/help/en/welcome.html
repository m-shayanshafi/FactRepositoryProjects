<h3>JSkat Help</h3>
<h4>Getting started</h4>
<p>
Basically, there are two ways to use JSkat:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To play offline against AI players</li>
<li>To play online, using JSkat as a GUI to the <a href="http://www.skatgame.net/iss/index.html">International Skat Server</a> (ISS)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Playing offline</h4>
<p>
To play against two computer AIs, you have to create a skat table and start a skat series at that table. 
Either use the menu or the corresponding button to create a skat table. You can name your table, if you like.
This is only necessary if you want to create more than one table at a time.<br>
Once the table has been created, you will find a button at the center of the table to start the skat series.
In the dialog you can set names for the AI players and yourself and you can choose the type of AI player you want
to play against:
<dl>
<dt>Algorithmic</dt>
<dd>This player has a set of rules defined, which decide what card to play in various situations. Unfortunately, 
this player is far from fully developed. So it might satisfy an occasional player, who just wants to play a short game. 
To a more experienced and demanding player, the algorithmic player will seem rather crude and stupid.</dd>
<dt>Neural network</dt>
<dd>This player uses neural networks for all decisions during a game. The neural networks are already trained. 
In a future version this player will adapt it's playing strength to the human player competing with it.</dd>
<dt>Random</dt>
<dd>The most stupid kind of AI player. At least, he knows the rules and always plays a valid card. However, from the 
set of possible cards, a card is chosen at random.</dd>  
</p>
<h4>Playing online</h4>
<p>
To play online, you first need to create an account at the <a href="http://skatgame.net/iss/registration.html">ISS</a>. 
After logging in you can either join a table that already exists and has free seats or you can create a 
new table and invite other players to your table. On the ISS you will find the best AI skat players known today.
