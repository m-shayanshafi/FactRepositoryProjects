About solitaire4j v1.0

Solitaire4j was build using wireless toolkit 2.0 and j2mepolish 2.2. Until now no more recent versions of such software have been used to 
test it. This crrent directory contents a solitaire4j_distro folder which holds the main jar and jad files to be used in mobile devices. They can be loaded and executed as
any other j2me software. The other folder, solitaire4j_src, contains the source code and other resources used to developed the application. Be free to change any part of it GNU license document. 

Solitaire4j v1.0 has been tested using a Siemens M56 cellphone with success; however, in other devices some GUI details can vary strikingly, so please tell 
how it works to try to solve the problems.
