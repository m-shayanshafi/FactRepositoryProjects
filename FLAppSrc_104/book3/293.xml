		It will cost you 30 Shards to buy a blessing.
		<if shards="30">
			<group>
				<text>Cross off this sum and write Luck</text>

			in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.

		The blessing allows you to reroll any one dice result. This needn&#8217;t necessarily be an ability roll; you could use it to reroll an encounter result that you don&#8217;t want.

	<p>
		You can have only one Luck blessing at a time, and it will work only once. When you use it, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. Now <goto section="44"/>.
