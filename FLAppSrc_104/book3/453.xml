		Among the shambling miners you notice one face - your former helmsman, Gaspar Savaloy. His cheeks, once ruddy and welllarded as any yeoman of Golnir, are now hollow; his formerly ample belly has been lost along with memories of good meals.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Mister Savaloy,&#8217; you say. &#8216;Here&#8217;s a pretty pass, eh?&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		It takes a few seconds for recognition to strike. &#8216;Skipper! If it ain&#8217;t me old skipper what I unjustly abandoned on that isle.&#8217; He starts to sway his head, eyes too parched for tears. &#8216;Help yer old helmsman, skipper.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		You discover from the mine supervisor that it will cost 30 Shards to pay off Savaloy&#8217;s indenture.
