		The Shadar were the race that ruled Harkuna in ancient times. The time of their reign is thought of as a golden age, where peace and harmony encouraged a flowering of arts and sciences. They were overthrown by the coming of the Uttakin, but some culture still survives in the form of hoary tradition.
