		The captain&#8217;s log contains some interesting accounts of his travels across the Great Steppes. You are particularly interested in a detailed description of a tomb he found. &#8216;It is only possible to gain entrance when the gods are not looking,&#8217; the captain has written in his log. &#8216;We were unable to penetrate to the heart of the tomb, but returned to the ship with much booty from the outer chambers.&#8217;
