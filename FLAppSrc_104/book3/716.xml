		You push up, dislodging the iron cover which falls aside with a clang. Emerging, you find yourself on a mist-swaddled street where high-towered edifices loom on all sides like phantom titans.

When you say you are lost, he points along the street to where a large latticed window gleams with mist-blurred lamplight. &#8216;This is Dweomer. Yonder is the west window of Maudlin College.&#8217;
