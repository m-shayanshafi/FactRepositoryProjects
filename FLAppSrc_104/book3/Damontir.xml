	<p>
		Haunted by memories of a former life in which he wielded great power, Damontir would willingly pledge his lifeblood to the demons of darkness if he stood to gain a snippet of magical lore. Power is his only goal, and so his primary objective is to enrol at one of the sorcerous academies in Dweomer.
