		After a short spell in the Yellowport militia (he mistakenly enlisted thinking he was joining a queue for alms), Silas signed on aboard a merchantman bound for Metriciens. He found that the fresh breeze and the open sea inspired his ballads, and resolved not to return to a landlubber’s life until he has learned the song of the mermaids.
