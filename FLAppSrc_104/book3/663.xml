		The trau are a subterranean race, the remnants of the gods&#8217; first abortive attempts to create man. They have a reputation for surliness, disliking to mix with mankind because they are jealous of man&#8217;s more perfect visage and well-fashioned form. However, the trau are skilled at metal-working and will sometimes sell trinkets of exquisite workmanship for nothing more than a sip of faery mead.
