		There is one ship for sale. She is a barque with a carrying capacity of 1 Cargo Unit; she will cost you 320 Shards.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;What about the crew?&#8217; you ask the man who is selling her.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Men from Marmorek,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Landlubbers every one of them, but they&#8217;re willing to learn.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		If you decide to
		<buy ship="barque" initialCrew="poor" shards="320" quantity="1">
			buy the ship
		</buy>, remember to cross off the money and record the details on the Ship&#8217;s Manifest. The Crew Quality is poor. Remember to change the entry in the docked column each time you arrive at a new port; it is currently docked at Dweomer, of course.
