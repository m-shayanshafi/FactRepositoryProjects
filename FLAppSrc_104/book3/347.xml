		The only temple in Brazen is consecrated to Molhern. It is a low stone building, artfully fashioned to reflect the style of ancient menhirs.

	<p>
		The priest cannot induct you into the inner mysteries of Molhern&#8217;s worship. &#8216;I am not senior enough for that, but I can grant blessings.&#8217;
