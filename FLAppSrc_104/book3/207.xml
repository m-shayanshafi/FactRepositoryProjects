		The Master&#8217;s lodgings are in a fine, old, stone house at the back of a lawn just inside the college gates. His lugubrious butler Mantel admits you into a study that smells of old books, pipe smoke and armchair leather.

	<P>&#8216;Who&#8217;s this?&#8217; demands the Master, looking up from his chair.</P>
	<P>&#8216;One of the students, I&#8217;m afraid, sir,&#8217; says Mantel.</P>
