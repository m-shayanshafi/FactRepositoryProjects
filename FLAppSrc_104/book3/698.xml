		&#8216;Once the pinnacle of civilization in the northlands, Old Harkuna is now but a wrecked shell of an empire, like the carapace of a crab discarded on a beach by gulls. The Uttakin conquered Harkuna in ages past, but the lands of Golnir and Sokara that were once its vassal states still maintain the vestiges of ancient tradition. Harkuna remains the model of kingship even though the High King&#8217;s Seat has been empty for three hundred years. Indeed, many superstitious folk still claim that the High King was never slain by the Uttakin, but sleeps under the frozen Rimewater and will arise when the World Snake spits fire and the end of the world looms.&#8217;
