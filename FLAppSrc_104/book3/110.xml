	Several skippers have loaded their cargoes and are ready to
	depart for ports in the north. You can get passage to Dweomer,
	Yellowport or Metriciens, for 35 Shards in each case. There is
	also a merchant who intends to go upriver to trade with the
	natives of the interior; he will take you along for 5 Shards.
	Alternatively, you could buy a ship of your own.
