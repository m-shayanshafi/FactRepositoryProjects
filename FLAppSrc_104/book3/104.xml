Within lies a hidden valley entirely surrounded by high cliffs - a paradise of bubbling brooks, emerald lawns, fruit trees and scented flowers. Strewn all around are gold, silver and gems as plentiful as pebbles in a merchant&#8217;s garden. With wild cries of delight, your men stuff their pockets with all they can carry.
