		You find two important references to the Innis Shoals. The first, in a book on navigation, reads: &#8216;These islands form an effective barrier to the western sea, being ringed with treacherous reefs and racked by constant storms. Only a skilled pilot can bring a ship safely through.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The other book deals with matters of religion: &#8216;A numinous essence is thought to pervade the air of this region. For this reason, the archipelago has long been accounted as a holy place and many a hermit has made his home here.&#8217;
	</p>

		All in all, the Innis Shoals hardly sound the place for a holiday. Unless you&#8217;re a religious maniac, that is. <goto section="368"/>.
