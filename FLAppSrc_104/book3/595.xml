		Your prow drives into the side of the Uttakin ship, which is unable to turn fast enough to avoid the collision. Water pours in through the broken timbers. With the weight of its metal flanks, the vessel is pulled down into the depths.

	<p>
		A few survivors come swimming across calling for mercy. Your crew club the Uttakin unconscious and loot their belongings.
