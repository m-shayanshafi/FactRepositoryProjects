		It is the wizard Targdaz, whom you freed from imprisonment inside a giant ruby. &#8216;I have come to tell you of a vacant castle in Old Harkuna,&#8217; he says. &#8216;If you&#8217;d care to take up residence there I&#8217;d be happy to serve as your court sorcerer.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Fine, but where is it exactly?&#8217;</p>
