	You are washed up on a narrow beach at the back of a bay
	surrounded by high mist-shrouded peaks. After resting to
	recover your strength, you pick your way up a series of steep
	paths until you can get a clear view of the island. To the north
	lies an expanse of glittering blue forest, so there can be no
	question where you are - Braelak, the Sorcerers&#8217; Isle. Nearer at
	hand is a tower built of obsidian blocks.
