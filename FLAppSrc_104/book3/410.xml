		The captain rewards you with the contents of his hold:
		<buy cargo="metals" quantity="2" shards="0">
			2 Cargo Units of metals
		</buy>.
		Note these on your Ship&#8217;s Manifest, assuming you have the space to load them aboard. (You can jettison your current cargo to make room, if you wish.)
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;What will you do now?&#8217; you ask the captain.</p>
	<p>
		He gives a quick bray of exhausted laughter. &#8216;Get my ship into port, sell her, and use the money to buy a tavern. I&#8217;ll never put to sea again, that&#8217;s for sure.&#8217;
