		If half of what you read about Akatsurai is true, it must be one of the strangest countries of the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		The knights of Akatsurai (who are known as <i>samurai</i>) are utterly without fear, striving gladly for death if only they can win honour with their last breath. In fact, honour is so highly prized that a samurai threatened with disgrace usually opts to take his own life by slitting open his belly with a dagger.
	</p>
	<p>
		The samurai are the rulers of Akatsurai, and any samurai can slay any peasant with no better reason than to test the edge of his sword! The chief of all the samurai is called the Shogun, whose court is in Chambara. There is also an Emperor, but according to most accounts he wields little true power.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also worth noting is a small and secretive sect of wizardly assassins which is active in the remote rural areas. They are known as ninja, a word which literally means Masters of Invisibility.
