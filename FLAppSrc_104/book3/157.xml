			If the score is less than or equal to your Rank, you manage to stay alive by clinging to a broken spar. On the point of death, with your vision blurring, you see a ship. Seawater fills your mouth as you try to cry out; all you manage is a feeble groan. The ship seems to jump closer in rapid flickering movements as you drift in and out of consciousness. At last you feel yourself being hauled aboard.

		You wake on a pallet below deck. You start to sit up, but you are still too weak after your ordeal.

		You discover that you have been picked up by an Uttakin slave ship. The slavers will only agree to release you if you can pay a ransom of 300 Shards.
