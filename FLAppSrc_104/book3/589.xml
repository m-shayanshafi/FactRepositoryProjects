		After searching up and down the narrow grey streets, you find a small shop with green bottle-glass windows. A peeling gilt sign above the narrow door proudly proclaims: &#8216;Vortense Pogue, purveyor of magical materials.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		Pogue turns out to be a thin man bound inside a tight velvet coat. He helpfully shows you his stock which, as he admits himself, is small but intriguing. (He is not interested in anything you might have to sell.)
