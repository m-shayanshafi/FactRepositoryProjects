		&#8216;The collective noun is a Threnody of Mermaids,&#8217; asserts one source, &#8216;and few who hear their song can resist its dread allure. According to popular belief, a troubadour who learned the song used it to cause all the inhabitants of Gutrein, a town in Old Harkuna, to abandon their homes and follow him. The town remains empty to this day.&#8217;
