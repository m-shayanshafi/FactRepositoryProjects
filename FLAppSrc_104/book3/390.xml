		The wise woman lives a reclusive existence. Her home is a cave in the cliffs high above the village. The islanders turn to her for medicine, soothsaying and the favour of the gods.

		She greets you with a sticky yellow smile and waits for you to fill her hand with silver. For <lose shards="5" price="x">5 Shards</lose> she will give you a blessing of <gain blessing="storm" flag="x">Safety from Storms</gain>. Note this in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet if you decide to buy it. You can have only one Safety from Storms blessing at a time, and it will work only once.
