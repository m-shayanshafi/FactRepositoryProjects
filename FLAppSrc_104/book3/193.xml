		The daylight is suddenly blotted out by vast clouds that spread like pools of ink across the sky. Lighting forms an incessant web from horizon to horizon, and the thunder is like being inside a great bronze bell. You bellow orders but they are only lost on the wind. The crew stare all around, limp with fear. Only luck can save you now.
