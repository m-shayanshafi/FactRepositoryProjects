		Somehow you manage to keep your head above water. You swim until your limbs feel as though they are caught in a net. You struggle on, mortally weak but determined not to give up.
	</p>
	<p>
		A ship heaves into view. You raise your arm and give a feeble cry. By some miracle you are spotted, and the ship steers towards you. You are hauled aboard, wrapped in blankets, and given a bowl of hot soup.
	</p>
	<p>
		To your immense relief, you have been rescued by merchants from Metriciens.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;We are bound for Dweomer and then home,&#8217; they say. &#8216;We&#8217;ll drop you off wherever you like.&#8217;
