	There are four vessels docked here at Braelak. The silk-robed
	captain of an Akatsurese galley is prepared to take you to
	Chambara for 20 Shards. A merchant whose vessel is bound for
	Ringhorn will take you along for 10 Shards. There is an
	explorer who wants 15 Shards to take you to Smogmaw. Or you
	can arrange passage to Aku aboard an Uttakin warship for 15
	Shards.
