	If you have a ship docked at Smogmaw you can either put to sea
	or sail upriver. Alternatively you may be able to hire passage
	aboard a merchant ship. In either case you will need to go to the
	quayside. It is also possible to travel on from here on foot, of
	course, but you are warned that the hinterland consists of wild
	jungle and dangerous marshes.
