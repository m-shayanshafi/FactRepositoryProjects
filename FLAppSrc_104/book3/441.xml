		Earlier in the day you had to order a lashing for one of the crew because of insubordination. Having escaped from the brig, the wretch comes stealing in on you in the night. If not for a creaky floorboard he would have cut your throat while you slept. As it is, he gets first blow <i>and</i> you must fight him without the benefit of weapon or armour.
