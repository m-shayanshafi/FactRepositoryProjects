		A low prow emerges from a bank of mist close off your starboard bow. As the vessel takes shape, you recognize the bronze shields along the sides that identify it as a slave ship from Uttaku. It heaves ponderously closer - powered, not by sails, but by huge paddles turned by oxen chained in the bowels of the ship.

		&#8216;Normally we could hope to outrun them,&#8217; announces the helmsman. &#8216;But they&#8217;ve come on us right close, and there&#8217;s hardly a breath of wind for the sails. We&#8217;ll have to stand and fight.&#8217;
