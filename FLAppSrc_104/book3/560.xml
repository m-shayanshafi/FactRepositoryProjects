	</p>
	<p>
		You wake up suddenly to hear him describing the Forest of Larun: &#8216;...which may have been the wizard&#8217;s tomb found by Silvanus Ent. Doctor Ent's studies suggested the demonic door of the tomb would respond to the password &#8220;Rebirth&#8221;. Who can say why? Let me tell you my own theory...&#8217;

		You doze off again. When you wake the next time, you are being carried back to your room by two college servants.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re lucky, sir,&#8217; says one chirpily.</p>
	<p>&#8216;How's that?&#8217; you ask, yawning.</p>
