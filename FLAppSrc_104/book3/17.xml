	<p>
		A few days out from Smogmaw the <i>Tidy Sum</i> is overhauled by your own ship. It is with enormous relief that you see the faces of your loyal lads at the rail.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Ahoy, you have our skipper!&#8217; calls your first mate to the Sokaran captain. &#8216;Heave to, if you please.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The Sokarans don&#8217;t want a fight. You are paid <gain shards="150"/> in compensation and returned to your ship. &#8216;A tidy sum,&#8217; you remark with a smile to the captain as you leave his vessel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that you are no longer docked at Smogmaw, then <goto sail="t" section="282"/>.
