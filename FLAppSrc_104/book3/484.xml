		Clutched in bony fingers, you and your men are hauled across to the other ship. Shrouds catch a foetid wind and slowly she picks up speed, leaving your own ship to drift abandoned.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are pressed into service below decks - a harsh servitude from which not even death can bring deliverance. Each day you watch with horror as your flesh dries up and sloughs away, leaving you a macabre living skeleton.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nothing can save you from undeath - not even any resurrection you may have arranged. Cross off all codewords and ticks in all your <i>Fabled Lands</i> books and start again with a new character.
