		Dangor is a city east of the Gashmuru Gulf. It stands atop cliffs hundreds of metres high, and you are particularly intrigued by the account of one Horbel Humbing, Master Mariner, of the HMS <i>Sokar</i>. &#8216;We arrived at the base of the cliffs and there laid at anchor three days, while a mountaineer carried our documents to the port authorities above. These documents being found to be in order, grapples were lowered and secured and the whole vessel was winched up to the docks a thousand feet above.&#8217;
