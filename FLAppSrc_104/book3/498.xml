		A blessing costs 20 Shards if you are an initiate, 40 Shards otherwise. You cannot buy a blessing from Molhern if you already have one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Molhern&#8217;s blessing allows you a second attempt at any one failed MAGIC roll. After the second roll (whether successful or not) the blessing is used up.
