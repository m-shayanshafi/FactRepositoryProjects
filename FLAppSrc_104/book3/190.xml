		Ringed about with desolate shores, the sea keeps up its eternal whisperings. It puts the mate, who is normally an irascible redfaced drunkard, in wistful mood. &#8216;Often when at home,&#8217; he says, &#8216;tiring of laughter and song, I take myself to a deserted bay and listen for the sea-nymphs&#8217; flutes that herald the tide.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re a poet!&#8217; says the navigator admiringly.</p>
	<p>
		The mate glares at him, jerked back to his usual foul mood. &#8216;There&#8217;s no call for insults, mister!&#8217; Look alive - we need a new course, you swab.&#8217;
