		&#8216;In the great forests of the southern land known as Ankon-Konu abide creatures whose like is not found elsewhere at any part of the world. In the higher branches there are fungi that can float on the warm breezes and ensnare monkeys and birds. With my own eyes I beheld a man slain by the crimson moss which can grow in great swathes overnight, suffocating the unwary. In leafy groves as dark as caverns I met with men whose eyes were like great jewels atop their heads. There are insects as hard and bright as glass, large as a man&#8217;s fist, and monkeys with the morals of a Metriciens street-thug. But strangest of all are the creatures that give Ankon-Konu the name by which mariners commonly know it. These creatures are the plumed flying fish of the jungle, and the name by which the continent is thus called is the Feathered Lands.&#8217;
