	<p>
		Varkung has always been fascinated by the distant places of the world. As a child he would spend hours staring at his father's maps and day-dreaming of the people and creatures who lived across the sea. Now, as a young man, he has the chance to go exploring. His first wish is to visit Starspike Island and see if, as legends claim, it really does stretch up beyond the sky.
