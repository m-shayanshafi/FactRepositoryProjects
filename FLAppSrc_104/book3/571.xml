	Dweomer is the famous City of Wizards. Lining its narrow,
	perpetually drizzle-soaked streets are the sorcerous colleges: great
	gothic edifices with portals that are as big as those of any castle.
	Gargoyles stare down the rooftops, crouching below the
	overcast sky. It is said that some of those gargoyles are failed
	students.
