		The camp is huge. Nomad warriors, winged Mannekyn People, soldiers of the king of Sokara and, at night only, many trau, rub shoulders here.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is an easy matter to get into the camp - you are one among many attracted to the economic opportunity an army represents.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the centre of the camp is a wooden stockade, where General Beladai and the other leaders of the army have their tents. This is well guarded.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are plenty of armourers and weaponsmiths here, buying and selling for the army.
