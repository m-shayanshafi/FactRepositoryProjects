		The high priestess is covered from head to toe in bright white silks - all you can see are her eyes, like twin orbs of amber. She tells you that the mirror of the Sun Goddess, a holy relic of the temple, has been stolen. She believes it has fallen into the hands of a steppe nomad, one of the Horde of the Thundering Skies, and asks that you retrieve it for them. In return, the temple will reward you.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Only a priest is worthy enough to handle the mirror,&#8217; she adds.</p>

	</p>
	<p>You leave her. <goto section="89"/>.</p>
