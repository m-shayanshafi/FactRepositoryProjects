		You realise that you are being subjected to some kind of spell or curse. It is affecting your judgement, filling you with the desire to kill Luroc. It is affecting him too, for he keeps glancing at you, and fingering his long dagger murderously.
	</p>
	<p>
		You endeavour to control yourself and explain the situation to Luroc. He understands, but it won't be long before both of you fall under the spell and become completely enraged.

	<p>2 <item name="dust of tranquillity" group="4.113"/></p>
