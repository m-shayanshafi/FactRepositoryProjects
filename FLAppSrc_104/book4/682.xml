		You manage to reach a ledge half-way up the mountain where you pause to rest. Suddenly, you are struck by a shower of pebbles. A dozen winged creatures are hovering in the air above you, pelting you with small rocks. They are like little purple-furred monkeys, with leathery bat-like wings - Mannekyn People. They wear simple strips of leather, and wield small javelins.
