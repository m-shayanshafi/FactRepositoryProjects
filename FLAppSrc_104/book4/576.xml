		After a time of aimless drifting, you come out on to the open sea. One day, you spot a bottle bobbing in the waves. You pluck it from the waters, and pop the cork.
	</p>
	<p>
		To your amazement, a great stream of scarlet smoke roars out of the bottle. The smoke condenses into a huge, fat-bellied genie, wearing a loincloth, and a bejewelled turban. His skin is bright red.
	</p>
	<p>
		The genie speaks in a rumbling baritone, &#8216;Ah, free at last! Thank you, small one, for freeing me. Now, as is customary in these affairs, I will grant you a wish as a reward. What do you desire?&#8217;
