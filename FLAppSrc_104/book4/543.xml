		The villa of Avar Hordeth is a white-marbled structure built in the Atticalan style - fortified walls surrounding an inner open courtyard. As you approach, an armed guard stops you at the gate.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Avar Hordeth is not at home,&#8217; he says gruffly, &#8216;Go away.&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		You have little choice but to do just that - there&#8217;s not much you can do in broad daylight. <goto section="280"/>.
