		The temple to Nisoderu, Goddess of the Rising Sun, is built around an open courtyard with a great shrine in the middle, covered in lit candles. Inside, a hundred nuns, dressed in flowering white robes, and wearing elaborate, wide-brimmed hats, sing a continuous chant in praise of her. The goddess is depicted everywhere as a beautiful woman with a face that shines like the sun. She represents not only the sun, but piety, faith and purity.
	</p>
	<p>
		The nuns of Nisoderu are skilled in the ways of petitioning the goddess to bring the dead back to life.

		If you are a Priest by profession, the high priestess will give you an audience.
