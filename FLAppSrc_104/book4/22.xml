		Cross off the 10 Shards. One of the men leads you through the mine. The walls are like frosted glass, and the ice radiates a bluish glow that fills the mine with an eerie wintry beauty. Miners work with axes and saws, cutting blocks of blue ice from the walls.
	</p>
	<p>
		You come to a large chamber, where several tunnels meet. One tunnel looks black and abandoned. Not even the chill radiance of the ice lights its dark passages.
	</p>
	<p>'What's down there,' you ask.</p>
	<p>
		'Down there? Why, that's the old mine. It's abandoned now,' says the miner.
	</p>
	<p>'Why hasn't it been flooded?'</p>
	<p>
		'We tried, but the water wouldn't freeze. It is an evil place - haunted, that's for sure.'
	</p>
	<p>'A ghost?'</p>
	<p>The miner just looks at you and says nothing.</p>
