		You make your way down a long tunnel to a hall which is lit bya thousand white candles and lined with tables. Here you are greeted by men and women who are clad in shrouds that they wear like togas; their faces are pale as marble, their eyes like dull grey jewels.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a presence in the deep darkness at the distant end of the hall. &#8216;Who goes there?&#8217; booms a voice that fills you with awe.
