		At a table in a shadowed corner, two people are talking. One is a short, disreputable-looking fellow, a nomad of the plains judging by his looks. The other is a large, fat, red-faced woman. You walk over, and introduce yourself. They react with astonishment at your temerity, and the man reaches for the long dagger at his belt.
