		The evening is drawing in and the moon rises, bleeding its light on to the snow. You are huddled around your camp-fire when a man runs at breakneck speed into the firelight. He is a nomad of the steppes, with a pale, wan complexion.
	</p>
	<p>
		He drops to his knees before you and says, &#8216;Help me! Help me! They have taken her to the top of the pyramid. They will surely kill her.&#8217;
