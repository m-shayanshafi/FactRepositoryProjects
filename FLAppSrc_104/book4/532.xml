		The doors are opened by the butler, Kevar. His long white hair is even longer now. Kaschuf himself, tall, strong, and as bald as ever steps forward.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Haven&#8217;t I seen you somewhere before? No matter, I&#8217;ll carve you to pieces, just like all the others!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		Kaschuf goes white with terror when you tell him that you have released his soul from a locket you found on an uncharted island.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kevar hops from foot to foot in glee and croaks, &#8216;Kaschuf is no longer Deathless! He can be killed - he can be killed!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;The fight&#8217;s not over yet, old man,&#8217; bellows Kaschuf, as he glares savagely at you. &#8216;I could still win!&#8217; Kevar freezes and claps his hand over his mouth.
