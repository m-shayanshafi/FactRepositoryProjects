		On the other side of the bridge waits an armoured knight mounted on a huge black lion. As he sees you he lowers his visor and readies his lance.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Prepare to joust,&#8217; grates his voice from inside the metal helm.

	<p>&#8216;I have no steed!&#8217; you protest.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;A misfortune,&#8217; he admits. &#8216;You should have come better prepared.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		He comes charging along the bridge.
