		Becoming an initiate of Nisoderu gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services the temple can offer. It costs 50 Shards to become an initiate. You cannot do this if you are an initiate of another temple.
		<if safeAddGod="Nisoderu"><if shards="50">
				If you choose to become an initiate,
				<group>
					<text>write Nisoderu in the God box</text>
					<tick god="Nisoderu"/>
					<lose shards="50"/>
				</group>
				on your Adventure Sheet - and remember to cross off the 50 Shards.
