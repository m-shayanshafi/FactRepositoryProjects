		You are recognized by the guards as of sufficient rank within the hierarchy of Akatsurai to be allowed into the palace.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are summoned to see Lord Kumonosu, daimyo of the Clan of the White Spear. His audience hall is a room of finely polished wood.
	</p>
	<p>
		He acknowledges your position as Hatamoto in the personal guard of the Shogun of Akatsurai. Although he and the Shogun are enemies, he treats you will enough. Kumonosu gives you a sealed letter and asks that you take it to the Shogun. Note the <item name="sealed letter"/> on your Adventure Sheet. You are shown out; you leave walking backwards, bowing the whole time.
