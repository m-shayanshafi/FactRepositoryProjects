		Hordeth&#8217;s last blow sends you reeling back, and in the press of combat, you and he are separated. You collapse, but one of your men binds your wounds in the nick of time - you come round with <lose staminato="1">one Stamina point</lose>. It is clear to both sides, however, that you lost the duel with Hordeth, and this will effect the morale of your crew.
