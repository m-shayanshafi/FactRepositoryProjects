		You are taken to see one of their princes, in a large blue and white striped tent. Inside, a man sits on the floor at a low table. At the sight of you he leaps to his feet.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;By Great Tambu!&#8217; he cries. &#8216;It&#8217;s you!&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		He is Akradai, Prince of the Azure Sky tribe. You saved him once, in Yellowport, Sokara. He was under a curse, and you released him from it. He promised then that he would reward you. Akradai gives you <gain shards="500"/>, and his shamans will <lose disease="*">cure you of any disease or poison</lose> you may be suffering from (but they cannot lift a curse).

	<p>
		They also prepare you a magical elixir, used by the nomads to hone their sense of direction, a
		<item name="potion of nature">
			<effect type="use" ability="scouting"/>
