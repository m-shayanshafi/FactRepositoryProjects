	<p>A scholarly-looking gentleman comes out of the back.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;So you&#8217;re the one Pikalik told me about,&#8217; he says in a thin, reedy voice.
	</p>
	<p>
		He tells you his name is Argon the Alchemist. He takes you to his sanctum, a laboratory full of vats and alembics. Several contain half-formed Mannekyn People.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;They are my creations, you see,&#8217; says Argon. &#8216;I grow them all, here, in the life-vats. I think of them as my children, and because you helped one of my people, I will help you.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		Argon will create a duplicate clone of your body in one of his vats. &#8216;If you are slain, your spirit will leave your body, and fly to your clone, and you will live again!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		Write <resurrection text="Sky Mountain" book="4" section="244"/> in the Resurrection box on your Adventure Sheet. If you are later killed, turn to <b>244</b> in this book. You can have only one resurrection arranged at any one time, so if you already had a resurrection deal from a temple, the temple one is cancelled. You do not get a refund.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you are ready to leave, the Mannekyn People fly you to the base of Sky Mountain.
