		You know from arcane bestiaries that this is a snake demon, bound by long-dead Shadar priests to guard their tombs. You recite a spell which is said to be effective against such demons. The beast recoils for a moment, and a green bile bursts from its eyes and ears. It shrieks in agony, but it does not die. Enraged, it closes in.
