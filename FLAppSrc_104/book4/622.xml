		The wreck is the tattered remnants of an Uttakin trader. Washed up nearby is some of its cargo. If you have a ship docked in Tigre Bay, you can fetch some of your crew, and take whatever cargo you can fit on board your own ship. If you haven&#8217;t got a ship here, you can&#8217;t carry the cargo - <goto section="669" force="f"/>.

		     This mostly works, except when the user fills up their
		     ship; any remaining cargo is still clickable, since
		     the ActionNodes are actually GroupNodes, and don't
		     monitor the state of their children that closely. -->
