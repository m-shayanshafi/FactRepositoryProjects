		As you draw nearer to the hill, dozens of figures rise up from behind the crest of a low mound. They wear massive helmets, sculpted to resemble beast faces - boars, dragons, pigs and the like. Their bodies are human but gnarled and deformed, and covered in mottled, silvery-grey fur. At the sight of you they give a roar of blood-lust and charge! There are so many of them, that you have no choice but to flee for your life.
