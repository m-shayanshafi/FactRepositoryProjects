		You conjure up a bristling wall of thorns, twenty feet high, and send it hurtling toward your opponent. At that instant, Dialla Earthdaughter does the same. The two walls meet in the middle of the arena with a thunderous crash. The thorns and brambles wrestle with each other, and you have to concentrate hard to maintain your wall of thorns, but Dialla's Druidic background gives her the edge. Your spell is broken, and her wall of thorns smashes through the remnants of your own wall, to bear down on you with frightening speed.

		You have only the barest moment to dive aside. <lose stamina="2d">Roll two dice</lose>, and lose that many Stamina points, as the thorns rip you in passing.
