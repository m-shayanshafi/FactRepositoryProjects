	The temple of Tambu is a wooden structure built to resemble one of the round tents of the nomads of the steppes. Tambu is the Great Spirit of the Steppes. When the Northern Lights flicker in the sky, it is said that the spirits of earth, sky and water are dancing for him. Tambu's blessing is said to aid those who travel across the steppes.
