		The black speck grows larger and larger until it becomes a huge bird, hurtling toward your ship like a thunderbolt. It is as big as a house, and its wingspan is as long as your ship with feathers as white as snow. It is a rukh, taloned and beaked like an eagle, and it swoops down, intent on plucking you from the deck.
