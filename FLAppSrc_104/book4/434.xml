		Inside, you find a heavy stone sarcophagus, around which has been arrayed the goods and materials for Xinoc to use in the afterlife. Much of it is decayed and rotten now, but not the more durable of items. You find a triangular key. Note the <item name="pyramid key"/> on your Adventure Sheet. You also find a <weapon name="Shadar sword" bonus="4"/>, some <armour name="heavy plate" bonus="6"/>, a jar of <item name="uncanny salts"/>, and a
		<item name="ring of defence +4">
			<effect type="use" uses="3" verb="Use">
				<desc>{uses} uses</desc>
				<tick special="defence" bonus="4"/>
			</effect>
		</item>
		(three uses). Note that the ring can be used three times only. You can invoke the ring before a fight, and it will add 4 to your Defence for the duration of that combat only. You also find some rainbow-coloured <item name="parrot fungus"/>, inside an old jar of oil.
