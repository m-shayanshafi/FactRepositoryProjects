		You are in-between the Gemstone Hills and the Citadel of Velis Corin. A vast army has made camp near here, some miles north of the citadel. It is alive with activity - caravans of supplies and camp-followers are everywhere.
	</p>
	<p>
		You learn that it is the army of the Northern Alliance, led by General Beladai. Beladai was the commander-in-chief of King Corin of Sokara's army, before Grieve Marlock usurped his throne. Now the new king-in-exile has made an alliance with the Horde of the Thousand Winds, the trau and the Mannekyn People of Sky Mountain. Together, they hope to take the citadel, and put the king back on the throne. They are readying themselves to march south and lay siege to the citadel. But the citadel is supposed to be invincible.
