	You have come upon the Ruby Citadel. It is a bizarrely structured tower, seemingly carved from a single ruby of gargantuan size. Legend has it that it fell from the skies in the time of the Elder Gods. Some say it was a palace of a minor godling, cast down during the War of the Gods, when Harkun himself was slain, and fell from the heavens. Harkun&#8217;s body created the world, and his blood the rivers. The citadel glows redly, casting a rosy hue over the snow. It is a beautiful sight.
