		You meet a troupe of people, marching through the steppes. There are nomads, townsfolk, even sailors by the look of them. Their clothes are in tatters, but they dance along tirelessly, a crazed, uncontrolled look in all their eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		At their head, a white centaur with a long white beard leads them a merry dance. Half horse, half man, he plays a haunting melody on a silver flute. The music is so beguiling that it fills your heart with a terrible, yearning desire to follow him, wherever ever he may go.
