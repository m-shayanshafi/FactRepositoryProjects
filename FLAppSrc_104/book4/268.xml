		Resurrection costs 200 Shards if you are an initiate, and 800 Shards if not. It is the last word in insurance. Once you have arranged for resurrection you need not fear death, as you will be magically restored to life here at the temple.
	</p>
	<p>
		To arrange resurrection, pay the fee and write
		<resurrection text="Temple of Nisoderu" book="4" section="250" shards="cost" god="Nisoderu"/> in the Resurrection box on your Adventure Sheet. If you are later killed, turn to <b>250</b> in this book. You can only have one resurrection arranged at any one time. If you arrange another resurrection later at a different temple, the original one is cancelled.
