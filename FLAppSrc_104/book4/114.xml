		You can take Hordeth's ship if you like. To do so,
		<buy ship="galleon" name="Sea Centaur" initialCrew="poor" shards="0" quantity="1">fill in the details</buy> on the Ship's Manifest. It is a galleon, called the <i>Sea Centaur</i>; you can transfer the crew from your own ship to the <i>Sea Centaur</i>.

		Decide which ship you want to travel on. The ship you don't want to use sails to Yarimura with a poor quality crew. Note that it is docked in Yarimura. <i>[You can transfer crew and cargo between the two ships by selecting 'Ship Transfer' from the 'Windows' menu --Ed]</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>Sea Centaur</i> was carrying <buy cargo="spices" shards="0" quantity="1">1 Cargo Unit of Spices</buy>, which is yours now. You also find <gain shards="150"/> in Avar's sea-chest, and a <item name="mariner's ruttier"/>. Note it on your Adventure Sheet. Your first mate tells you that the ruttier will help in navigating certain dangerous waters.
