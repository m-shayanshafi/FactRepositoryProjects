		Your men are inspired by your brave leadership, and with a bloodthirsty roar, they follow you up the beach. A bitter struggle ensues, a desperate contest fought on slippery rocks and in salty surf. The rain courses down, and lightning flashes across the sky. You come up against a huge, red-bearded giant of a man wielding a massive iron club. You&#8217;ll have to fight him.
