		You remember an old Shadar codex you discovered in the Icicle Woods. It told of the Cave of Bells, and the ancient rituals of the Shadar priest-kings. They always rang a bell called The Whisperer first, so you go over to it, and rattle its clapper.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no sound at first, but then the other bells begin pealing, weaving a harmonious tapestry of sound.

		A wooden panel slides open at the other end of the cathedral. You walk through into a large, granite chamber where you find
		<gain shards="2000"/>,
		some <armour name="plate armour" bonus="5"/>,
		an <weapon name="enchanted sword" bonus="4"/>,
		a <tool name="gold holy symbol" ability="sanctity" bonus="3"/>
		and the <item name="sceptre of kings"/>.
		The sceptre is made of a hard, bluish metal, its tip fashioned into the head of a hawk.
