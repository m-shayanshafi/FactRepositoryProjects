<section name="Dilmun Snow-Walker" profession="Wayfarer">
	<p>
		Dilmun is a scout and hunter, the best in his tribe - but he wants to be the best in the world. He has heard tell of a stairway in the Peaks at the Edge of the World, and that they lead to a place beyond the world. With the blessing of Tambu, great spirit of the steppes, perhaps he can find this place, and prove that he is truly the best.
