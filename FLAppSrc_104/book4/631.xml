		You find a poor shipwrecked sailor, clinging to a piece of driftwood. Unfortunately, he has expired - still holding on even in death. It seems he was once a captain. You find his log, the last entry of which reads: &#8216;We set sail today with a good wind behind us. I am worried, however, that we couldn&#8217;t afford to buy a blessing from the temple of Alvir and Valmir.&#8217;

	<p>You sail on. <goto section="236"/>.</p>
