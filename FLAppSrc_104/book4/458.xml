		The shaman throws back his head and stares directly upwards as if reading his answer from the ice-bright pattern of the stars. &#8216;A foreign lord lies sleeping there, under the hard waters. His dreams are dreams of life. When life becomes an intolerable nightmare, then he will awaken.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The legends of Old Harkuna say that the High King will return in the country&#8217;s hour of need.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Is there any other way to wake him?&#8217; you ask.</p>
	<p>
		He thrusts a vial of <item name="uncanny salts"/> into your hand. Note this on your list of possessions. The salts smell pungent, like smelling salts.
