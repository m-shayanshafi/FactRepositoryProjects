		The captain&#8217;s first mate recognizes you, but you have no idea who he is. He is amazed you don&#8217;t know him.

	<p>
		&#8216;Don&#8217;t you recognize your old friend Clarny Dukes,&#8217; he whines, distraught. &#8216;You saved my life, when we were lost in the Desert of Bones. Don&#8217;t you remember?&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		You remember nothing. It must have happened during a period of your life of which you have no memory whatsoever. At any rate, you pretend to remember, and the first mate persuades the captain to let you live.
