		The streets are a maze of smoky alleys and dark passages built around a central square. The square contains a hulking mansion of dilapidated stone. A large door, with several dodgy-looking cutthroats loitering around outside, has a banner hanging over it that reads: Brotherhood of the Night.
	</p>
	<p>
		Around the square, Thieves&#8217; Kitchen is divided into three areas - rough, very rough, and extremely rough!
