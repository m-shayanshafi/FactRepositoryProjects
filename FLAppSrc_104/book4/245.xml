		You step back involuntarily, as they reach for you with supernatural speed, night-black talons questing for your throat. Then they freeze.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;I smell faery mead!&#8217; says one.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Well, it&#8217;s going to be mine, then,&#8217; says the other.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Oh, no!&#8217; says the first. &#8216;It&#8217;s my turn.&#8217;</p>
