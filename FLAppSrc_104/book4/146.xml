		The woman's name is Floril Dellas. She is a washerwoman, and she works for a rich merchant from Metriciens called Avar Hordeth, who owns a villa just outside town. According to the washerwoman, his treasure vault is stuffed full of wealth.

		Luroc Bans says, 'Floril's given me a map of the place. I can get in there but we need a tough accomplice to help deal with whatever is guarding the treasure. Something is, but no one knows what. Once we've grabbed the loot, and got out, we split everything three ways. What do you say - you in or out?'
