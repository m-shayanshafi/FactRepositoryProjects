		Since the ice melted, operations at the mine have all but ceased. A miserable looking Jalalul, the overseer of the mine, sits inside the main building. He has lost much weight, but he&#8217;s not out of business yet. The stores of ice stockpiled in the warehouse will take months to melt, and, since it is the only rime ice left, he can command a good price for it. A satchel of <buy item="rime ice" shards="150" quantity="2"/> costs 150 Shards. You cannot carry more than two satchels. If you buy any, cross off the money and add the rime ice to your Adventure Sheet.
		<!-- can we think of a way to stop the player returning and buying more ice? -->
