		You come to a door of solid basalt. In front of it sits a shadowy shape, with eyes of ruby red. It stands up on four black legs, and growls a throaty, booming growl, baring rows of razorsharp teeth. It is a faery hound, a trau guard-dog, and it looks about to pounce.
	</p>
	<p>
		You have heard stories that these black hounds can be soothed to sleep with beautiful music or song.
