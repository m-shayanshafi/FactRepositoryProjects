		King Nergan asked you to talk to Beladai, and see what assistance you could give him. The guards at the stockade take you to Beladai&#8217;s tent, a large pavillion of purple silk.
	</p>
	<p>
		Inside, General Beladai, a tall, grey-haired veteran of many campaigns, is there to meet you. His face is fixed into an expression of determined efficiency, like a granite slab. Around him are the other leaders. Lek, Wing-warrior Chief of the Mannekyn People, is a small, purple-furred, bat-winged humanoid. The trau warlord, Marack Mander, squats in a shadowy corner, wreathed in shadows. Olog Khan, a wiry, hawk-nosed nomad, is leader of the troops of the Horde of the Thousand Winds.

		They explain that the citadel is all but invulnerable to their army, as they have no means of breaching the walls.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;You are our only hope,&#8217; growls General Beladai. &#8216;A single spy could infiltrate the citadel and open the Great Gate from the inside.&#8217;

	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Come back if you change your mind,&#8217; grunts Beladai.</p>
