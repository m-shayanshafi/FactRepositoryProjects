		You have come to the ice-bound shores of the Rimewater. The lake is completely frozen over, and the ice has a strange sheen to it. Three sluggish rivers, thick with half-frozen water, debouch into the lake from the north. On the southern shore of the lake sits a small complex of buildings, from which smoke spirals into the clear, crisp sky - the ice mine.
