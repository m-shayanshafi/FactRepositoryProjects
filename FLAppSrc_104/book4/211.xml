		Several days pass. You are fed and watered, but Grilb is becoming anxious, and you begin to worry for your safety. Eventually, a letter arrives from Marlock City, in Sokara. Grilb, grim-faced, reads it to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		'General Grieve Marlock does not deal with terrorists. Your captive is not my concern.'
	</p>
	<p>
		General Marlock has abandoned you, despite the fact that you did his dirty work for him, disposing of Nergan Corin and Beladai. And just to save a lousy 500 Shards.
	</p>
	<p>
		Grilb says, 'If you can pay the ransom, I'll let you go - if not...'
	</p>
	<p>
		Your only hope is if you have 500 Shards in the bank at Yarimura. Turn to <b>600</b>, make a withdrawal, if you can, and then select the option 'Paying a ransom'. <i>[Instead of going to <b>600</b>, you can withdraw money from the box below --Ed]</i>
