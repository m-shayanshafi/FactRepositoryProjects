		You wait until nightfall before approaching the villa. Its white, marbled walls seem to glow in the moonlight. Four guards patrol the perimeter.

	<p>
		&#8216;Psst! a voice hisses from the darkness, and Luroc Bans steps up beside you. He is dressed completely in black, and is carrying a grappling iron.
	</p>
	<p>
