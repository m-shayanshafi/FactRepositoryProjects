		A strange ship emerges from the fog bank. It is barely seaworthy, a floating wreck with rotting rigging, and mouldy timbers. But it is the nature of the crew that draws your attention - ghostly forms, undead pirates, spectral figures that leap and dance, wielding rusty cutlasses. A tattered red pennant flies from the mast.

	<p>
		Your crew is filled with dread. &#8216;Ye gods,&#8217; wails the first mate. &#8216;It&#8217;s a ghost ship - if they catch us, they&#8217;ll take our souls down into the cold, dark deeps!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The spectral ship surges towards you in silent pursuit as the hot sun beats down.
