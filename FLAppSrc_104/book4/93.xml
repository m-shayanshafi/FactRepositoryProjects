		For every Rank you are above one, you can add one to the die roll (i.e. if you are 5th Rank, add four to the roll; if you are 3rd Rank, add two to the roll), and for every <lose shards="50" price="x">50 Shards</lose> you cross off and give to the crew, you can <tick name="CharismaBonus" count="1" flag="x">add one</tick>. You can also add one if the crew is of good or excellent quality.
