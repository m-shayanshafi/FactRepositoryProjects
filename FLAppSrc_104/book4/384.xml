			If you are an initiate it costs only 15 Shards to purchase Molhern&#8217;s blessing.
		</if>
		<else>
			<set var="cost" value="25"/>
			A non-initiate must pay 25 Shards.
		</else>
		<lose shards="cost" price="x">Cross off the money</lose> and
		<tick blessing="magic" flag="x">mark MAGIC</tick>
		in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you fail a MAGIC roll. It is good for only one reroll. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You can have only one MAGIC blessing at any one time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once it is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Molhern to buy a new one.
