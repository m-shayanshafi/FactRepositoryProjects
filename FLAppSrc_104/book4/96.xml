	Becoming an initiate of Juntoky gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services the temple can offer. It costs 50 Shards to become an initiate. You cannot do this if you are already an initiate of another temple.

			If you choose to become an initiate,
			<group>
				<text>write Juntoku in the God box</text>
				<lose shards="50"/>
				<tick god="Juntoku"/>
			</group>
			on your Adventure Sheet - and remember to cross off the 50 Shards.
