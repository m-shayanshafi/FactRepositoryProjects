		The rukh&#8217;s claws pluck you from the deck as if you were a rabbit in a field. You are carried up and up; the pale, upturned faces of your crew grow more and more distant, until your ship is nothing but a speck on the ocean.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will never see them again. <lose ship="t">Cross the ship, cargo and crew</lose> off your Ship&#8217;s Manifest.

		The rukh screeches deafeningly; its wingbeats are like thunder. It flies for hours until it comes to a remote mountain peak. There it tosses you unceremoniously into a nest made of tree trunks where a young rukh is cawing for food. The parent flies off, but you must fight the chick, which is twice your size!
