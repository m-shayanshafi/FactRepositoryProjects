		A small bottle is bobbing in the water nearby. You pick it up, pull out the cork, and take the paper from inside. On it, a message reads, 'Don't open the bottle. And whatever you do, don't read this message.'
	</p>
	<p>
		Instantly, you drop the bottle and its contents, terrified you may have incurred some kind of curse, but nothing seems to have happened. Puzzled, you return to your ship.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, the tide rises, and refloats your ship. You sail on. <goto section="471"/>.
