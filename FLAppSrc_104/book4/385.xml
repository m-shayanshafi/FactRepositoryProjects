		A golden tower slowly materializes before you, hanging some fifty feet above the plain. Sunlight reflects off the tower, making it look like a gigantic blazing torch and bathing the snow with golden light. The tower begins to flicker indistinctly, as if it were a mirage. A hazy, insubstantial golden stairway descends from the tower to the ground. You try to walk up it, but your feet pass through the first step as if it wasn&#8217;t there.
