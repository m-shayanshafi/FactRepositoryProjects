		Molhern is the god of knowledge. Here on the island, the mages worship an aspect of the god called Molhern Magister, whose domain is the magical arts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the mages of Sokara and Golnir reject the gods. Here, a peculiar sect of mages has embraced the worship of Molhern. The temple is a single spire reaching skyward, with a great eye painted on its topmost pinnacle. A sorcerer-priest welcomes you to the temple.
