	The redcaps have you cornered and you have no choice other than to fight them. They carry pikestaffs in their hands, and great talons grow from their fingertips. Their long, spiked teeth are dripping with saliva: coarse hair grows from their heads and falls over their shoulders like wire. Four of them close in with murderous intent. Fight them as if they were one opponent.
