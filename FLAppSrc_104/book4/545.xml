		Thinking fast, you tie the rope between two gnarled stumps of dead marsh trees. The hut hurtles towards you with frightening speed, and an eerie howling fills the air - Gura Goru, spurring her hut onwards. But its legs are caught by the rope, and the whole thing comes crashing to the ground.
	</p>
	<p>
		A scream of rage spills from the hut, along with a shower of objects - a cooking pot, some rags, firewood and the like.
	</p>
	<p>
		You find a
		<tool name="cross-staff" ability="scouting" bonus="2"/> and a
		<item name="verdigris key"/>,
		that fall at your feet. Note them on your Adventure Sheet.

	<p>
		Gura Goru is shrieking at the hut to get up, so you make a run for it while you still can. <goto section="92"/>.
