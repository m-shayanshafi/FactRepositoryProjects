		Night is falling and it becomes ever more cold as the last of the sun&#8217;s warmth leaves the Great Steppes. You stumble across an ancient ruined tower. There is little left of the roof but you manage to huddle in a corner which shelters you from the cold wind.

		You sleep uninterrupted for a few hours but you are woken by a rustling sound. At first you see nothing but then you manage to make out two small red lights a few feet away from you, then another two, then four more.
	</p>
	<p>
		You realise they are not lights but fiery red eyes just as a fireball is thrown to the floor by one of the creatures. The fireball lights up the whole ruin - you can see you are surrounded by redcaps, a particularly unpleasant type of goblin.
