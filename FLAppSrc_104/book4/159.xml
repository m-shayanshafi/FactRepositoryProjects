		You step into a small antechamber. Inside, the red glow is so bright it hurts your eyes. You can feel it vibrating slightly, and this vibration causes a low, thrumming hum like the sound of a multitude of bees.

	<p>
		Two figures shamble toward you. Their half-rotten flesh, rusting armour and putrid smell tell you they are undead. They fix their dead-white eyes upon you, and utter a wordless cry of bloodlust, gripping their pitted scimitars in quivering, skinless hands. The ruby light gives them an awful, hellish cast.
