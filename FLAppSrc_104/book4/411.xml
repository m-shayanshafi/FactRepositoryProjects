		You have only one choice - to lead your men in a concerted attack up the beach, and try to defeat the wreckers in battle. Otherwise you will be picked off one by one. As for the ship - you can see that it will be lost. With a vengeful battle cry, you try to rally your crew.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Up and at &#8216;em, lads!&#8217; you shout, and, waist deep in the water, you charge at the beach.
