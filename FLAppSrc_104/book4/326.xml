		You find a feeble old man sitting by the dirt track you are following. His eyes are almost sightless, and his hands quiver and shake with ague. As you near, he pushes out a basket in front of him, trying to sell you his wares. All he has for sale is an ancient scroll, engraved with gold letters and strange glyphs. He wants 5 Shards for it.
