		At last you reach the end of the stairs. You have come to the flat top of one of the highest peaks of all. Northward is only blackness, the yawning, star-filled emptiness of the gulf between the worlds, spoken of only in myth and legend.
	</p>
	<p>
		Standing before you is something else from legend. It is a dragon of enormous size, with three heads. From its three mouths smoke and flames belch forth into the sky - it was the dragon&#8217;s triple breath that made you think this peak was a volcano. On the other side of the dragon, you see an archway that frames stairs that descend into the blackness beyond.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the dragon&#8217;s heads turns its lambent amber eyes upon you. Its voice is like an earthquake.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;I am the Celestial Dragon of the North, Son of Great Tambu. None but the blessed may descend the Stairway of the Land Below the World.&#8217;
