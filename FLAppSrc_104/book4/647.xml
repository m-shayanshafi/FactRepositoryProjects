		Throughout a short day the sun has hovered in the west like a guttering candle, throwing long deep gullies of shadow across the bleak landscape. Now it dips lower, grazing the horizon, and frost starts to speckle the ground.

		In the gathering twilight you see a band of nomads about four hundred strong. They ride on beasts that at a distance resemble bulls, but as they get closer you see their muzzles are like broad hairy parodies of human faces.
	</p>
	<p>
		The outriders dismount, glaring at you. You see the nomads&#8217; distrust of strangers in their eyes. They plant themselves between you and their wagons. Then, jabbing the ground with their spears, they start to chant a shrill song.
