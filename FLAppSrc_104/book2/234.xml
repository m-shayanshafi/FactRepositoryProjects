	Maka is the dread goddess of disease and famine, who must be
	propitiated to ensure good harvests. When Maka is angry, the
	crops are struck with pestilence and people go hungry. Her
	temple is a high-gabled building of dark wood with narrow
	leaded lights that admit only a dismal gloom to the interior of
	the nave.
