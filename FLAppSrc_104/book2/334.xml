		Becoming an initiate of Sig gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services. Also, you can add 1 to your THIEVERY score, as Sig will watch over your pilfering activities and keep you safe from the law. It costs 50 Shards to become an initiate. (You cannot do this twice to obtain a double THIEVERY bonus!) You must not be an initiate of any other temple.
