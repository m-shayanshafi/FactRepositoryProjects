		A merchant is packing to leave at the same time you are. &#8216;You travel through Castle Ravayne quite a bit, I suppose?&#8217; he says. &#8216;We can expect a change there quite soon, I hear,&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;What sort of change?&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;A new head of the House of Ravayne. The Knight of the Long Knife is plotting against that young sprat Vanna. Not that I care one way or the other. Merchants may be no better than thieves, as people say, but in that case the nobility are even worse - they&#8217;re thugs!&#8217;
