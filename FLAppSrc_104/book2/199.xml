	You are travelling cross-country in eastern Golnir, in the rolling
	hills that sweep down towards the broad river valley of the
	Grimm. A horse trader tells you that the town of Goldfall is
	close at hand. &#8216;See this scar on my forehead?&#8217; he says, pulling off
	his straw hat. &#8216;A nugget fell from the sky and brained me, so it
	did! But a villain made off with my nugget while I lay stretched
	out senseless on the grass.&#8217;
