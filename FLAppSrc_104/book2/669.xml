		You meet a thatcher who is giggling to himself about how much money he&#8217;s making. He explains his technique over a flagon of cider: &#8216;I arrive in a village and sell shares in the thatching of the roofs.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		You&#8217;re puzzled. &#8216;But surely you don&#8217;t own the roofs? The villagers do.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Ah, but then I point out that if they buy shares in a neighbour&#8217;s roof, they&#8217;ll be able to charge him rent.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;People would have to be stupid to fall for that!&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		He grins. &#8216;Good thing they are, then. I make a pretty penny selling people their own roofs, I can tell you.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re in the wrong line of work. <goto section="265"/>.</p>
