	<!-- regal helm - treat as regular armour? or additional? -->
	The floor of the belfry is virtually covered with silver, gold and precious gems - all sprinkled with bat guano. Two items draw your gaze: a
	<weapon name="golden sword" bonus="2"/> and a
	<armour name="regal helm" bonus="3"/>. You can take these two items: record them as possessions on your Adventure Sheet. You can also try to gather some treasure before the vampire bats wake up.
