	You approach the captain of a two-masted merchantman. He
	looks you up and down and rubs his jaw thoughtfully. &#8216;Where
	are you bound?&#8217; he asks. You soon discover that passage to
	Dweomer or Marlock City will cost you 10 Shards, while
	passage to either Yellowport or Aku costs 15 Shards. You can
	pay the fare and set sail at once, or give up and review your
	other options instead.
