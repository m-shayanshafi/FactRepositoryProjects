	You are grabbed and hauled in front of the Piepowder Court:
	seven ruddy-cheeked farmers in homespun smocks who barely
	know a half-dozen paragraphs of criminal law between them.
	Although you protest your innocence, as a stranger in the district
	you are convicted of theft. You are fined all your cash
	(<lose shards="*">cross it off</lose> your Adventure Sheet),
	given a birching and then left in the
	stocks to be pelted with rotten fruit. <goto section="199"/>.
