		A mason who has been working at Castle Ravayne mentions that he is supposed to renovate the private citadel of Sir Bredubar, the Knight of the Long Knife. &#8216;I don&#8217;t know why he thinks the place needs fortifying,&#8217; says the mason. &#8216;Maybe he knows something I don&#8217;t. Still, the money&#8217;s good.&#8217;
