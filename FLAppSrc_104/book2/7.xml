	The Forest of the Forsaken is a dark forbidding place. Even in
	broad daylight, shadows cluster like a mass of cobwebs under the
	gnarled boughs. As you skirt the forest searching for a path, you
	see a hamlet at the edge of the trees. A man looks up as you
	approach and starts to ring an iron bell.
