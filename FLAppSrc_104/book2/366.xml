	The path wends its way between steep earthern banks from
	which the roots of trees protrude like ossified snakes. It brings
	you to a squat crypt built of green-veined grey marble. Above
	the entrance rises a small pyramid with a stone eye carved into
	the summit. In the centre of the eye sparkles an emerald as large
	as a duck&#8217;s egg.
