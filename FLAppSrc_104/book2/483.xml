		You talk fast and think faster. &#8216;This is the head of my poor brother,&#8217; you say, falling to your knees in the roadway and sobbing. &#8216;He was captured by an ogre who cooked him - all except for the head, which the vile monster considered inedible. Now I am taking him to Castle Ravayne to plead with the wizard Estragon to restore him to life.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>

	<p>&#8216;When he&#8217;s sober,&#8217; adds one of the troopers quietly.</p>
