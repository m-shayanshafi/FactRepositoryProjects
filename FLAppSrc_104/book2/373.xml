	At the side of the coastal road there is a weathered old fort. It
	looks abandoned, with moss cladding the pitted black stones of
	its high walls. Its empty windows stare out to sea. It may be a
	relic from ancient times, when the ruthless Uttakin swept up out
	of the south to conquer all Harkuna.
