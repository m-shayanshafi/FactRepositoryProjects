		You are ambushed by a band of outlaws in wolf-pelt jerkins. They jump up from behind a ridge. You see at a glance that they far outnumber you, but they make no move to attack. Their leader signals for his men to lower their crossbows before scrambling down from the ridge to speak with you. &#8216;No offence,&#8217; he says with a grin, &#8216;but one lone wanderer isn&#8217;t worth the trouble of robbing.&#8217;

		Maybe he&#8217;d think differently if he could see inside your money-pouch? Or perhaps they are really put off because you look too tough to handle without casualties? See if you can impress them by

			making a THIEVERY roll
		</difficulty>
		and
		<difficulty ability="charisma" level="13" var="y">
			a CHARISMA roll
		</difficulty>, both at a Difficulty of 13.
