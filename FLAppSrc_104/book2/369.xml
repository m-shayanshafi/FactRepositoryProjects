		&#8216;Knocklar, you oaf!&#8217; says the severed head. &#8216;You dropped me in the forest again. If not for the kindness of this stranger I&#8217;d have lain there until morning with beetles crawling up my nostrils!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		Knocklar takes the head and smiles. &#8216;You must stay a while and tell me of your adventures,&#8217; he says. &#8216;I have renounced the world myself in favour of a life of spiritual contemplation.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;A life of drunken idleness, more like!&#8217; declares the head in outrage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knocklar leads you into his cottage where, ignoring the head&#8217;s protests, he stuffs it into a breadbin. Then he invites you to stay and have supper with him.
