				in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet. The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you make a failed SCOUTING roll. It is good for only one reroll. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You can have only one SCOUTING blessing at a time. Once it is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Lacuna to buy a new one.
