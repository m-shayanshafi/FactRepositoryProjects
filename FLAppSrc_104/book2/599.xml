		A lady calls to you from the window of a fortified tower as you pass by below.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;I&#8217;ve been abducted by an evil knight,&#8217; she says. &#8216;If you see my champion, pray tell him where I am.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Do you need rescuing?&#8217; you call back.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Thank you for the offer, but I think my champion will want to do that himself.&#8217;
