		The boat wends its way sluggishly upriver against the current. The rich fields gradually give way to grazing land and rugged heath. One evening at dusk you see a pallid green light flickering far off in the east, across the desolate countryside. The sailors tell you the light shines from the top of the Tower of Despair. &#8216;A haunted place where an ogre king once dwelt,&#8217; adds the captain in a hushed voice.
