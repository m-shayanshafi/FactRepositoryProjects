		You come across a goblin crouched on a toadstool. It is chewing a dead rat.
	</p>
	<p>
		The blood dribbles down its chin as it looks at you, grins and says: &#8216;She works hard to fill her larder. Her mother dined after killing father.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s that?&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		The goblin gobbles up the last bit of the rat. &#8216;Answer that riddle, and you&#8217;ll know the safe door to take in the old fort on the coast.&#8217;
