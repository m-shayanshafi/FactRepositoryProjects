		If you are an initiate it costs only 10 Shards to purchase Tyrnai&#8217;s blessing. A non-initiate must pay 25 Shards.

	<p>
		<lose shards="cost" price="x">Cross off the money</lose> and
		<tick blessing="combat" flag="x">write COMBAT in the Blessings box</tick>
		on your Adventure Sheet. The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you make a failed COMBAT roll. It is only good for <i>one</i> reroll. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can have only one COMBAT blessing at any one time. Once it is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Tyrnai to buy a new one.
