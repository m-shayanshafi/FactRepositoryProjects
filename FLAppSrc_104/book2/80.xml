		You meet a figure palely loitering under the gibbet. The hairs on the back of your neck rise when he steps forward and passes his hand right through you. &#8216;Yes, I am dead,&#8217; he moans. &#8216;Wrongfully executed on this gibbet for a crime I did not commit. The real murderer had me framed, but I&#8217;ll be avenged on him yet, with your help. He wears a velvet patch over one eye. Find him and bring me what lies under the patch. I&#8217;ll be grateful, never think I won&#8217;t...&#8217;

		He vanishes. A shiver passes up your spine. However long ago this crime was perpetrated, the spirit cannot have rest until his tormentor is dead.
