		You receive the blessing of Molhern. This allows you a second attempt to any one failed MAGIC roll. After the second roll (whether it is successful or not) the blessing is used up. Write:
		<tick blessing="magic">MAGIC reroll</tick> (one use) under the blessings on your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		You cannot obtain a second blessing from Molhern until this one is used up.
