	Sir Debrumas, the seneschal, takes you in to the baroness&#8217;s court.
	She sits in regal splendour on the gilded seat of House Ravayne.
	A gonfalon showing the black lion crest hangs on the wall
	behind her. Although young and slender, she has the fierce
	unflinching gaze of one who is born to rule. &#8216;Why have you
	come?&#8217; she asks.
