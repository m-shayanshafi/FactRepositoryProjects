		The interior of the tomb is lighted by a greyish glow. A corpse in ancient knightly regalia lies on a stone slab. Awakened by your approach, it sits up. Cobwebs veil its eye sockets and its skin looks like the bark of a dead tree. It extends an accusing finger.

	<p>
		&#8216;For disturbing my slumber I should strike you dead where you stand,&#8217; it intones in a gravid voice. &#8216;But there is a way for you to earn a reprieve.&#8217;
