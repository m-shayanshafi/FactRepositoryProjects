		You get to hear about a spice shipment from Ankon-Konu that is due to arrive in port within a few days. &#8216;I got the news from a wizard who&#8217;s just come from Dweomer,&#8217; says the merchant who is telling you this.

	<p>
		&#8216;How come his ship got here before the one with the spice?&#8217; He gives you a knowing smirk. &#8216;I said he&#8217;s a wizard. He probably flew here on a demon&#8217;s back!&#8217;
