	Your attempt to conjure an illusory dragon just produces a soft
	bang and a bad smell. Cackling with glee at your ineptitude, the
	witches cast an extraordinary hex on you. You now find that
	you are compelled to travel to the Haunted Hills without delay.
	You cannot stop at any towns or inns on the way. Once you
	reach the Haunted Hills, the compulsion will leave you and you
	can act normally.
