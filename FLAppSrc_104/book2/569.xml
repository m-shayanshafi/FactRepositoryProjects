	While you sleep, the ghost gnaws at your leg. Having died of
	starvation, it is driven to eternally crave flesh. You feel nothing,
	but the ghost is not sated until you have
	<lose stamina="1d">lost 3-18 Stamina points</lose>
	(roll three dice). If you can survive that, you wake at dawn to
	find your leg horribly mauled. Only then do you recall the
	wispy grey visitation that at the time you took to be a dream.
