	You search through the taverns along the waterfront, looking for
	seasoned sailors willing to crew your vessel. It costs
	<buy crew="average" shards="20"/> to upgrade a poor crew to average,
	<buy crew="good" shards="40"/> to upgrade average to good, and
	<buy crew="excellent" shards="80"/> to upgrade good to excellent.
	(These prices are cumulative, so the total cost of bringing a poor crew up to excellent is 140 Shards.) Once you&#8217;ve recorded any changes to your Ship&#8217;s Manifest, <goto section="255"/>.
