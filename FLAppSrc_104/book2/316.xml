		Resurrection costs 200 Shards if you are an initiate, 600 Shards if not. (If you have the title Chosen One of Nagil it is free of charge.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Resurrection is the last word in insurance. Once you have arranged for resurrection you need not fear death, as you will be magically restored to life here at the temple.
	</p>
	<p>
		To arrange resurrection, pay the fee and write
		<resurrection text="Temple of Nagil" book="2" section="339" shards="cost" god="Nagil">
			Temple of Nagil (<i>Cities of Gold and Glory</i> <b>339</b>)
		</resurrection>
		in the Resurrection box on your Adventure Sheet. If you are later killed, turn to <b>339</b> in this book.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can have only one resurrection arranged at a time. If you arrange another resurrection later at a different temple, the original one is cancelled. (Cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You do not get a refund.)
