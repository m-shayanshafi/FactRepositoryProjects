		The corpse reaches out its skeletal hands, clutching your throat in a grip like a noose of ice. You struggle to break free, but your limbs have lost their strength. A ghastly chuckling pounds in your ears as the corpse feasts on your soul.

		<difficulty ability="sanctity" level="15">
			Attempt a SANCTITY roll at a Difficulty of 15
		</difficulty>.
		<success>
			If the roll is successful, your spirit is too pure for the fiend to ingest: you are hurled out of the tomb with the <lose stamina="3d">loss of 3-18 Stamina</lose> (roll three dice). If you survive, <goto section="22"/>.
		</success>
		<failure>
			If you fail the SANCTITY roll then even resurrection cannot save you from being utterly destroyed by the vampire knight.
