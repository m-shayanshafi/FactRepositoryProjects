		His story concerns a man who found a copper pot under a tree stump. He wisely left a little silver in this, and was rewarded with health and good luck. He told his lazy brother about the pot, and he did the same. But the brother wasn&#8217;t content with just health and luck, so he tried to bribe the faery folk with bigger and bigger gifts. Finally they gave him a wart so big that it covered his whole face.
