		The Three Fortunes are the goddesses of fate, who weave the tapestry of all men&#8217;s lives. A placard outside the temple declares: &#8216;Join the temple and see your luck change overnight!&#8217; Inside, a vast wall painting shows a three-faced deity with six limbs hurling down nuggets of gold from a palace among the clouds.
