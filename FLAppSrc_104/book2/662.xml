		You present the Baroness with 100 Shards (or all that you&#8217;re carrying, if you don&#8217;t have that much on you). &#8216;What is mere wealth?&#8217; you declare gallantly. &#8216;I exist only to serve you, my lady.&#8217;

		Sir Debrumas accepts the money on Vanna&#8217;s behalf, as it is not seemly for one of high birth to handle the coins of merchants. You are escorted from the court and fetched back later for a banquet. If injured, <rest stamina="1">recover 1 Stamina point</rest> (up to the limit of your normal unwounded score).

		The next day you awaken refreshed and ready for any adventure. <goto section="342"/>.
