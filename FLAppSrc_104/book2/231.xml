		The elves are watching you, as invisible as ghosts in the foliage. They cruelly amuse themselves by rearranging your nose so that it looks like a carrot pointing straight up into the air. You can only undo this spell by
		<difficulty ability="magic" level="13">
			making a MAGIC roll now at a Difficulty of 13
		</difficulty>.
		<failure>
			If you fail the roll, you will be the butt of ridicule for everyone you meet and you must therefore
			<lose ability="charisma" amount="1">
				lose 1 from your CHARISMA score
			</lose>.
		</failure>
