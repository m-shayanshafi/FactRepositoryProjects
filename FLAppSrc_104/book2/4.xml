		The temple of Alvir and Valmir is a white marble building with a wide portico which gives a panoramic view of the harbour. The air in the nave is cool and fresh after the blazing sunshine outside.

	<p>
		Alvir and Valmir, the twin gods, are responsible for storms at sea. Sailors believe they take the souls of the drowned down to their halls beneath the vasty deep.
