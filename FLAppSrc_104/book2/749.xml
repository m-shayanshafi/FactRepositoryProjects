		It begins to drizzle with rain. Strolling along, you see seven worried shepherds wading about in the middle of a stream waving their crooks in the air. Their dogs are watching in amazement from the banks. &#8216;Whatever are you doing?&#8217; you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;We&#8217;ve decided to herd fish instead of sheep, because you can&#8217;t sell mutton on Friday,&#8217; replies one.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;But now it&#8217;s raining, we&#8217;re trying to round the fish up so they don&#8217;t get wet,&#8217; puts in another.
	</p>
	<p>Shaking your head, you set off down the road. <goto section="265"/>.</p>
