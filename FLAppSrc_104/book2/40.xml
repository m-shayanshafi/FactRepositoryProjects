		Something about the man makes you suspicious. Pretending to need to answer a call of nature, you watch from a bush while he goes through your belongings. You bide your time until he is occupied before stealing back everything he took off you, plus a few of his own possessions for good measure. He suspects nothing, and when it is time for you to go your separate ways he bids you farewell with a cheery wave.
