	You approach the captain of a Sokaran brigantine which is soon
	to set sail. He is happy to make a little extra money by taking a
	paying passenger along. You soon discover that passage to
	Marlock City or Ringhorn will cost you 10 Shards, while
	passage to Yellowport costs 15 Shards. You can pay the fare and
	set sail at once, or give up and review your other options
	instead.
