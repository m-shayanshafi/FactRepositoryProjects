		It is late afternoon when you cross a bridge near a mill pond. The seven fools are wading around at the water&#8217;s edge with rakes in their hands, lunging at the pond. They seem quite agitated, and when you ask what the matter is one replies: &#8216;Just look! The moon&#8217;s gone and fallen into the pond, and we better have her out by nightfall or who knows what trouble there&#8217;ll be.&#8217;
