	Instead of sails, the wizards&#8217; ship is propelled by a peculiar web
	of thin copper wires that produces a subsonic hum. You see the
	three wizards who command the ship standing in the prow,
	above a figurehead shaped like the snout of a sabre-spined
	dragon. Their long robes of blue and violet silk are decorated
	with patterns of silver filigree.
