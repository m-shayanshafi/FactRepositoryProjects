		To renounce the worship of the Three Fortunes, you must pay 25 Shards to the priesthood by way of compensation. The priestess begs you to think again. &#8216;Those who worship the fateful trinity will surely prosper,&#8217; she maintains. &#8216;But those who turn their back on the goddesses will soon meet them in their own guise - the dreadful weird sisters who preside at every man&#8217;s deathbed.&#8217;
