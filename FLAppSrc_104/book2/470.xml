	You go out the next day, and the next. Sometimes you find a
	tiny bit of gold, More often you come back to town emptyhanded,
	and each day you swear that unless you strike it rich on
	the morrow you are going to give up looking. But it is too late
	-you have gold fever. You spend all your money on gadgets
	that are supposed to help with prospecting: copper sieves,
	dowsing rods, gold-sensitive ferrets and so on. After six weeks
	you have nothing to show for it.
	<lose shards="*">You are flat broke</lose>, and the
	gadgets you bought are worse than useless. Sourly, you pack up
	and leave town, vowing never to return. <goto section="104"/>.
