		The blessing of Sig costs 10 Shards if you are an initiate, 30 Shards otherwise.
		<if shards="cost">
			If you buy the blessing,
			<group>
				<text>cross off the money and mark THIEVERY</text>
				<lose shards="cost"/>
				<tick blessing="thievery"/>
			</group>
			in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.
		</if>
	</p>
	<p>
		The blessing works by allowing you to reroll any failed
		THIEVERY attempt once. When you use the blessing, cross it off
		your Adventure Sheet. You can then make a second try at the
		roll.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can have only one blessing for each ability at any one
		time. Once your THIEVERY blessing is used up, you can return
		to any branch of the temple of Sig to buy a new one.
