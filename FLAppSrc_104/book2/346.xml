	A <b>severed head</b> lies on top of a tree stump. Its eyes are open and, moving closer, you are given a nasty shock when it suddenly speaks: &#8216;I have a favour to ask. Would you take me to the hut of the hermit Knocklar? He&#8217;s always taking me out with him when he goes to cut wood and then leaving me behind.&#8217; Having said its piece, the <item name="severed head"/> falls silent and closes its eyes. Add it to your list of possessions if you wish, then <goto section="116"/>.
