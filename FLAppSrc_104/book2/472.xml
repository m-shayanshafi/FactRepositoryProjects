		He tells a story a kindly old wizard who found a little dwarf asleep under a bush. He took the dwarf as his apprentice, but after only a month he woke up to find that the dwarf had stolen a suit of magic armour. This armour was empty but could still move and fight, because it contained an elfin ghost.
