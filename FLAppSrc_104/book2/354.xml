		You trawl through the taverns along the waterfront, looking for able seamen willing to crew your vessel. It costs
		<buy crew="average" shards="15"/> to upgrade a poor crew to average, and
		<buy crew="good" shards="30"/> to upgrade average to good. You cannot upgrade higher than that in Metriciens, because there aren&#8217;t enough good sailors.
