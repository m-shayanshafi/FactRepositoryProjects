	Here a knight has set up his pavilion. Encased from head to foot
	in plate armour, he sits astride his horse in silence while his
	dwarfish squire scurries forward on stunted legs to speak with
	you. &#8216;My lord contests your right to use this path,&#8217; the dwarf
	tells you. &#8216;You must fight him or else turn back.&#8217;
