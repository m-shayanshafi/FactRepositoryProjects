		Lacuna is the moon goddess and the overseer of the hunt. She is the patron deity of woodsmen, hunters and those who walk in the wild corners of the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Her temple here in Haggart&#8217;s Corner is a simple log-built chapel with bronze shields set along the walls. Grass carpets the floor and there is a smell of heather in the air. Pine cones smoulder on the altar.
