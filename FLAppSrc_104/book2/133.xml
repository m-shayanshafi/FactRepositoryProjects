		If you are an initiate it costs only 10 Shards to purchase Maka&#8217;s blessing. A non-initiate must pay 20 Shards.
	</p>
	<p>
		<lose shards="cost" price="x">Cross off the money</lose> and mark <tick blessing="poison" flag="x">Immunity to Disease and Poison</tick> in the Blessings box of your Adventure Sheet. The blessing works by allowing you to ignore any one occasion when you would normally suffer from disease or poison - for instance, the venomous bite of a snake. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can have only one Immunity to Disease and Poison blessing at any one time. Once it is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Maka to buy a new one.
