	Conflass is a delightful town of white-fronted houses with
	brightly painted timber frames. The burghers of the town are
	open and friendly. As one explains to you: &#8216;We tell the baronies
	that we pay tax to the Sokarans, and the Sokarans that we pay
	tax to Castle Ravayne. So they both leave us alone. That&#8217;s why
	you&#8217;ll never find a long face in Conflass.&#8217;
