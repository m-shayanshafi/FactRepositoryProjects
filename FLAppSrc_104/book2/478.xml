		He tells a story of trau that for some reason took up residence in a farmer&#8217;s field. It caused no trouble until harvest-time, when it decided to make its bed in the haystacks. Each day the farmer and his sons piled up the bales of hay, only to find them scattered all over the field by the following morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;You know what that farmer did?&#8217; says the storyteller. &#8216;He got a pot of faery mead, which the trau love. The trau got drunk on the mead that was left out for it, fell into a doze, and the farmer&#8217;s sons killed it with their pitchforks when they found it the next day asleep in a haystack.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Where did he get the faery mead?&#8217; you ask.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Ah. That&#8217;s a different story.&#8217;</p>
