		&#8216;The Watcher was a knight who made a pact with the demonic gods of the Uttakin,&#8217; says Knocklar. &#8216;He thought he&#8217;d get eternal life, but instead he became a corpse that could not quite die. He lies in his crypt dreaming of treasure and lost hopes.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Where is his crypt?&#8217;</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>&#8216;How much is the jewel worth?&#8217; you wonder.</p>
	<p>
		Knocklar scowls. &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you what it&#8217;s not worth. It&#8217;s not worth touching - not if you value your sanity! Now, I&#8217;ve got things I should be getting on with...&#8217;
