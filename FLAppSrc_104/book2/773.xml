		You pass a poor old tramp who has no trousers. &#8216;I hung them on a branch yesterday while I saw to a call of nature,&#8217; he says. &#8216;But some rascal made off with them.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The following morning you see seven fools watering a tree by the side of the road. &#8216;It&#8217;s a clothing tree,&#8217; they explain. &#8216;We got some trousers off it a couple of days ago, and now we&#8217;re watering it to see if we can get a coat and hat as well.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;You preposterous oafs,&#8217; is all you can say.</p>
	<p>
		As you continue along the road, you hear one of them say: &#8216;Here, aren&#8217;t we supposed to fill the watering can first?&#8217;
