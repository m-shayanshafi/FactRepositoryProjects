		A vagabond in ragged clothes tells you he has lately returned from the Feathered Lands, which lie far to the south across the ocean. &#8216;It is a land of marvels,&#8217; he avers. &#8216;There is a hole right through the world there, and men study the stars through it. Another town is built around the feet of a great colossus that holds up the sky. On the east coast are plains where a tribe of gold-skinned men feud with a tribe who have blue skins. In the deepest desert they keep a flotilla of ships, and in the western jungles I saw clumps of moss crawling like caterpillars.&#8217;
