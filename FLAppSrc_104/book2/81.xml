	Goldfall is a ramshackle town. The buildings are in poor repair,
	the livestock wanders untended in the fields. The reason is that
	most people who live here are just transients. They come from
	far and wide because of the stories that chunks of gold shower
	from the sky on certain nights. You pass a beggar squatting
	beside the town square and ask if he ever found any gold.
	&#8216;Nope,&#8217; he says. &#8216;But I heard of a bloke that got rich from
	finding three nuggets each as big as your fist. Got any spare
	change?&#8217;
