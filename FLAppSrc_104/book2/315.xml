	Castle Ravayne is virtually a city in its own right: the outer
	courtyard is filled with stables, grain stores, pens for livestock,
	carpentry yards and a smithy. Nearby, some knights are keeping
	fighting fit by charging with lances at a straw-filled dummy.
	Beyond, another line of defences encloses the inner keep.
