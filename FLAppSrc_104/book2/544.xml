		You try to convince the outlaws you are as ruthless and experienced as any of them. Unfortunately it comes out sounding like a hollow boast. Your miserable attempt at roguish nonchalance falls flat; your charm comes across like nervous prattling; the accounts of your crimes seem obviously to be lies.

	<p>
		One fellow with a scar running right across the bridge of his nose gives you a long hard stare and says: &#8216;What&#8217;s got you jittery, pal? Couldn&#8217;t be us, could it, mates? Sweet as lambs, we are!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>He rocks with laughter. But his eyes aren&#8217;t laughing.</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly they grab you, strip you of everything you possess, and pelt you with clumps of turf until you are driven away.
