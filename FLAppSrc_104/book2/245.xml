	You come to a road running north-south. A wandering
	entertainer stands nearby changing the wheel of his cart. He tells
	you that the road runs between Wheatfields and Metriciens.
	&#8216;Both cities are dens of traducers, venifers, and sundry other
	callid rascals,&#8217; he says resentfully. &#8216;I advise you to shun them,
	those edacious fustilugs in their gaudy baudekins!&#8217;
