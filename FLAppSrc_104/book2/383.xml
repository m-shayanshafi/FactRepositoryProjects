		The seven fools are building a fence around a tree where a cuckoo is nesting. When you ask why, their explanation is that the song of the cuckoo tells them it is time to start sowing the crops. &#8216;If we keep the cuckoo penned up all year, we&#8217;ll be able to get in two or even three harvests, won&#8217;t we?&#8217;

	<p>Just as he says that, the cuckoo flies off.</p>
	<p>
		The seven fools scratch their heads. &#8216;We&#8217;ll have to build it higher next year,&#8217; says one.
