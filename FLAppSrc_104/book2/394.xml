		An insane old man dressed in a long grey robe comes stumbling up the path towards you waving a stout stick. His spittle-streaked beard and wild mane of hair remind you of the temple images of Nagil, the Lord of the Departed.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;The world will soon end!&#8217; he cries. &#8216;What will it profit you then to have the goodwill of the gods? They are doomed just as we are, fool!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		He touches you with his stick and barges past, disappearing around a bend in the trail. When you hurry to catch up, you find he has vanished.
