		You are in a vast chamber. It is dark and hazy with blue resinous smoke. Glimmering lamps sparkle along the distant walls. Ravens flutter among the high black rafters.
	</p>
	<p>
		Trestles line the room. Seated there are countless people with white faces and red rheumy eyes. Something draws your eyes to the far end of the hall, where a cowled figure sits on a gnarled wooden throne.
