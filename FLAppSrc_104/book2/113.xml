		If you are an initiate it costs only 10 Shards to purchase Elnir&#8217;s blessing. A non-initiate must pay 25 Shards.

			in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.
		</if>
		The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you make a failed CHARISMA roll. It is good for only one reroll. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can only have one CHARISMA blessing at any one time. Once it is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Elnir to buy a new one.
