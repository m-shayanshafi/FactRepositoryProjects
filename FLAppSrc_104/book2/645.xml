	You come across an old bogle laughing to himself. His body
	looks like a mossy old tree-stump and he has a mouth as wide as
	a sack of coal. When you ask why he&#8217;s laughing, he replies:
	&#8216;Because there you are gawping instead of running away, and
	now I&#8217;m about to up and eat you.&#8217;
