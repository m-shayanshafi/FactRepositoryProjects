		You have come to the green and hilly expanses of north-east Old Harkuna. To the north, the mountains of the Spine of Harkun climb heavenward. To the east, the River Rese curls lazily southward. A thin column of smoke marks the village of Spatterdash, nestling between a couple of round hills a few miles off.
