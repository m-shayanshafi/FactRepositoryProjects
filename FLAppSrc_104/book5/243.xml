		You are threading your way through the swamp, along a narrow, well-trodden path, when a stooped old woman with a cane steps out in front of you. She is horribly ugly, so ugly, in fact, that she looks like a large, fat toad.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Well met, traveller,' she croaks. She warns you that the path is treacherous and offers to guide you safely through the swamp.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Follow me, an' I'll see you safe, in return for a Shard or two,' she rasps.
