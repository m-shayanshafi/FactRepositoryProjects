		This barrow contains a circular chamber at its centre - all around the walls hang decaying corpses. The fresh ones are garrotted and dangle from a hangman's noose - the skeletons grin from gibbets. You feel your own throat tighten as a dark figure emerges from the gloom, thin and tall. His magic chokes you as he draws a long pale sword. You must fight.
