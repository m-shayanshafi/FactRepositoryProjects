		Becoming an initiate of Tyrnai gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services that the temple can offer. To qualify as an initiate you must have a COMBAT score of at least 6. You cannot become an initiate of Tyrnai if you are already an initiate of another temple.

				If you choose to become an initiate (and meet the qualifications) <tick god="Tyrnai" force="f">write Tyrnai in the God box</tick> on your Adventure Sheet.
