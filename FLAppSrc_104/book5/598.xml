		The Hall of Heroes is a cosy tavern, a welcome break from the rigours of travel. At one table sits a group of local farmers, at another a motley group of adventurer types - a mage, a priest and a couple of hard-bitten veteran warriors.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tavern-keeper, a fat, barrel-chested, red-faced man called Bylewyn Buskle, hails you from the bar.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Welcome, stranger,' he bellows, looking you up and down with greedy-looking eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can stay here as long as you like.
		<rest shards="1" stamina="1">
			The tavern costs you 1 Shard a day
		</rest>.
		Each day you spend here, you can recover 1 Stamina point if injured, up to the limit of your normal unwounded Stamina score.
