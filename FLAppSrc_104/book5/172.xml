Note that you have gained one additional circle of bokh mastery; if you have no skill in bokh, note that you are now a 1st Circle Master of bokh. Trial by bokh is an old custom of the Uttakin. A plaintiff or defendant can always choose trial by bokh to resolve his case - so it is always important to make sure you can play the game well!
