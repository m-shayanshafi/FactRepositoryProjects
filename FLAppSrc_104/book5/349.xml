		'Welcome, mighty adventurer,' says an old, black-toothed peasant. 'Ye goin' to try your hand against Grindel the Ripper?'
	</p>
	<p>
		You ask if anyone has seen Grindel, and how many people he has carried away.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Oh, he be huge, and covered in scales, strong as strong can be, toothed and fearsome, like a two-legged dragon!' says one.
	</p>
	<p>'Aye, and he carried off ... who was it now?' says another.</p>
	<p>
		'Well, there was, hmm, can't remember any locals been taken recently. Mind you, there was Faldered the Fearsome, that mercenary. We found his head on the road. And Obraid the Capable, a mage from Dweomer - we found his body-parts scattered all over the stableyard! "Obraid the Incapable" we put on his tombstone!'
	</p>
	<p>They laugh uproariously.</p>
