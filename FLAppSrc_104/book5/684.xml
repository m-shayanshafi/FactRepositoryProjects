	You have been killed by vampires. You come back as an undead vampire yourself, cursed forever to roam the night in search of blood. You cannot be resurrected, and you can hardly continue adventuring as a vampire! Your career is over - you'll have to start again with a new character (don't forget to erase all the codewords and ticks in all the <i>Fabled Lands</i> books you've adventured in).
