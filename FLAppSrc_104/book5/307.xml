	You are in the northern Grumes. From your vantage point, you can clearly see the major feature of this area: the Lake of the Seven Needles, source of the Ruby River. To one side, you see clear signs of mining equipment - perhaps to mine the iron that is so common in this range of peaks. You can also hear the roar of a nearby waterfall and see the blood-coloured spray, which rises high and fades eerily into the thin sky.
