		The instant you open it, you are blasted by a hideous faerie curse. Note you are suffering from the
		<curse name="Curse of Vulnerability">
			<effect ability="defence" bonus="-3"/>
		</curse>.
		Subtract 3 from your Defence until you can find a way to lift the curse. Inside the chest, however, you find a
		<item name="scroll of Ebron"/>,
		a <tool name="flute" ability="charisma" bonus="1"/> and a
		<item name="potion of healing">
			<effect type="use" uses="1" verb="Drink" description="+5 Stamina">
				<desc>+5 Stamina</desc>
				<rest stamina="5"/>
			</effect>
		</item>
		which can be used at any time, once only, to restore up to 5 lost Stamina points.
