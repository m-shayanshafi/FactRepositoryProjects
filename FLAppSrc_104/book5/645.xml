		The Red Garden is where the Uttakin dispose of their criminals and heretics. The condemned are thrown into the large sunken garden, and the suckered tendrils of the carnivorous alalakh plants that flourish in the pit drain them of their blood, and dissolve their flesh. The leaves, barbed vines and strange, bulbous, mushroom-shaped flowers glisten redly in the sun, pulsing with the blood of their victims.

		A wire fence has been erected around the top of the pit. Masked lords and ladies of the court amble around the edge, taking an unholy pleasure in the viewing of these grisly executions. Victims are herded into the pit, screaming horribly, by the Expungers. Death is agonizingly slow in coming. Several of the lords and ladies are taking bets as to which victim will be consumed first, and such-like. What ignominy should this fate befall you! <goto section="444"/>.
