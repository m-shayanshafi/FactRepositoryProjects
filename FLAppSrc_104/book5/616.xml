		You are chained to a large millstone grinder, which you and several others have to push round and round, day after day. You are well fed and cared for, however, like a farmer's valued workhorse. <rest>You can restore any lost Stamina points</rest>.
	</p>
	<p>
		On your immediate left is a blue-skinned Uttakin called Isputakhsus Uilusa. Blue skin is the mark of a pure-bred aristocrat of Uttaku. You wonder what terrible crime a noble could have committed to end up a slave. He tells you it was for supreme heresy.

		'If it wasn't for my noble birth, I would have been executed in the Red Garden,' he explains.
	</p>
	<p>
		'The Red Garden?' enquires another slave, a bald-headed nomad of the northern steppes.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Best you do not ask about the Red Garden ...' says the Uttakin mournfully, before sinking into a despondent silence.
