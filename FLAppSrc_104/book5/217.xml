		You have arrived in the Icicle Woods, where the trees are tall columns of blue crystal, three or four times the height of a man, and the leaves are frosty tendrils of ice. The fruit of these trees resemble icicles of turquoise crystal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The floor of the forest crunches crisply underfoot, for it is a layer of frozen hoar-frost. It is cold, but eerily beautiful, and the crystal trees vibrate in the wind, a sound like the strings of a violin being played.
