		You emerge in the cell next to yours. You find it occupied by a white-haired old man. He tells you that he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for running off with the daughter of one of the courtiers of the Spider Palace. He says his sentence is up, and that he will be freed tomorrow. The bureaucrats of the prison match his sentence with the number of the cell and not its occupant.
	</p>
	<p>
		'I am too old to rejoin society,' he rasps. 'Let us swap cells. My life is already over - in this way at least you will be freed and some good will have come of the tragedy that has been my existence.'
