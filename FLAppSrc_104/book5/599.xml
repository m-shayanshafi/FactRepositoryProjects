		It is the last word in insurance. Once you have arranged for resurrection you need not fear death, as you will be magically restored to life here at the temple.
	</p>
	<p>
		To arrange resurrection, pay the fee and write
		<resurrection text="Temple of Tyrnai" book="5" section="500" shards="cost"/>
		in the Resurrection box on your Adventure Sheet. If you are later killed, turn to <b>500</b> in this book. You can have only one resurrection arranged at any one time. If you arrange another resurrection later at a different temple, the original one is cancelled - cross it off your Adventure Sheet, you do not get a refund.
