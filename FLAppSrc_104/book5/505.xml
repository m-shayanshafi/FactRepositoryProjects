		You are walking through the green countryside when a man on a flying throne swoops down out of the sky! He has bright blue eyes, and a long white beard that trails behind him in the wind for several feet. He looks completely out of his mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Ha, ha!' he cries insanely. 'It's another visit from Holyamu the Unbidden!'
	</p>
	<p>
		He flies past and drops a bucket of foul-smelling liquid over your head, before disappearing into the sky, laughing madly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The stuff smells like skunk-juice. Note that your
		<curse name="Skunk-juice" lift="Are you at a river, village, town or city?">
			CHARISMA rating is reduced by one
			<effect ability="charisma" bonus="-1"/>
		</curse>,
		until you can get to a river, village, town or city, where you can wash your clothes and restore your rating to normal.
		<i>[You can lift this curse when appropriate by double-clicking it or right-clicking and selecting 'Lift curse...'. Be honest! --Ed]</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Roundly cursing Holyamu with every insult you can think of, you journey on.
