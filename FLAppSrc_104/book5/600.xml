		A sleek war-galley courses through the waves towards you. It has the wind behind it, and you are unable to escape. As it draws near, you see the decks are crowded with an evil-looking crew of cutthroats and villains. The pirates pull alongside, and grapple your ship with determined efficiency. They board you, and a bitter battle ensues.
