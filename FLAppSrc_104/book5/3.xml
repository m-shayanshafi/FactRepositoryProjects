		You step forward bravely, and call out a challenge. The door slams open, and out steps a huge, man-shaped reptilian beast. Its scaly skin is a greenish hue, and its hands end in massive, iron-hard talons.

What is it with you hairy, ugly little monkey-people!' Grindel picks up a tree trunk by the door, and hefts it like a mace. He glares at you. 'Come on then, though we don't have to fight, you know.'
