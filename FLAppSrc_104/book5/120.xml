		You come to a village where a priest of Ebron, dressed in ragged robes, and looking as if he hasn't washed in weeks, is addressing a crowd of peasants. He is exhorting them to kill a dog that belongs to the local shepherd.
	</p>
	<p>
		'This foul beast,' he yells, pointing at the dog, 'has committed heresy! It has herded sheep on a day sacred to Ebron, and must suffer for its crime.'
	</p>
	<p>
		The priest goes on to say how the peasants will also be guilty in the eyes of Ebron if they don't enforce the holy laws. He rants on, a fanatic gleam in his eye. The villagers are soon whipped into a fervour, and prepare to do the dastardly deed.
