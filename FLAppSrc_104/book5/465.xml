		You arrive at the northern flow of the Ruby River. The water is a reddish hue, discoloured by iron ore carried down from the Grumes.
	</p>
	<p>
		A hairy troll steps out from under the bridge that spans the river here. He wears a wooden mask, like the lords of Uttaku, and has two scarves wrapped around his neck, a striped one, and a spotted one.
	</p>
	<p>
		'There's a toll of five Shards to use the bridge,' growls the troll menacingly, hefting the tree trunk he uses as a club.
