		The High King was driven out of this land long ago by the Uttakin. His castle stands empty now, choked with vines. If legends can be believed, the High King was not slain but retreated to a place in the far north, where he lies 'under a vault of water' with his knights, sleeping until the day comes for him to return and bring the golden age of prosperity back to his people.
