		Your boots become caked in red dust as you clamber through the mountains of the central Grumes. The path opens out over a narrow, steep valley, at the north end of which is a curious-looking cave. If you want to investigate the cave, put a tick in the above box,
		<group>
			and turn to <b>86</b>
			<tick/>
			<goto section="86"/>
		</group>.
