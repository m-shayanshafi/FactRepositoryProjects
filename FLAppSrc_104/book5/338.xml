		A handsome man, wearing a gold turban and silken robes, floats down out of the sky on a flying carpet to land beside you.
	</p>
	<p>
		'The name's Prince Azim. Look after this for me, would you?' he says matter-of-factly. He hands you a large sack. Then he takes off, and disappears into the distance. You notice several black specks in the sky that appear to be pursuing him.

	<p>
		Looking inside the sack, you find <gain shards="2000"/>! Note them on your Adventure Sheet.
