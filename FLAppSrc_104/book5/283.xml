		You have been selected by the Superintendent of Gladiators to fight in the arena for the entertainment of the masked lords of the court. Uttakin gladiators fight unarmed, using an ancient martial art called the Blue Grass Way (an obscure reference to the original homeland of the Uttakin, in the Blue Grasslands of Ankon-Konu). You receive basic training in unarmed combat.
