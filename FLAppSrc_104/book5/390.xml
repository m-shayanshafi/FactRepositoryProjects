		You manage to grab a nice, fat velvet purse. Suddenly the purse yells, 'Help, help! Someone's stolen me!'
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately for you, you've lifted an enchanted purse. Within seconds a patrol of the Soulwatch is upon you. You try to lose yourself in the crowd, but one of the Soulwatch begins to keen in a weird high-pitched tone, and several more patrols begin to converge on you. One of them manages to touch you with a purple-gemmed baton and it discharges a bolt of violet energy into your body, throwing you backwards to the ground. You are seized and dragged off to the dungeons.
