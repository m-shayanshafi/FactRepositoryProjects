		The Uttakin originally came from a desert land, and it shows in their insatiable taste for gushing fountains, songbirds, flower-fringed ponds and lush overhanging foliage. Every polished marble pavement is a lattice of sunlight and blossom-scented shadow, every wall a mural of ivy and bright flowers. The sky-line of towers and domes looks like a mural in delicate pastel colours against the deep cloudless blue.
