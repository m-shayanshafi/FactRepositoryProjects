		Since you freed the High King from his frost-bound sleep, Old Harkuna has thrown off the yoke of its cruel Uttakin masters. Spatterdash has become a thriving little town.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you walk down the high street, the people stop and stare - they recognise you as their saviour. The mayor, a fat little fellow, comes out to welcome you, and the townsfolk hold a celebration in your honour. Casks of ale are broached and the young people dance and play around the maypole. A temple to the Three Fortunes has sprung up as well as a small market.

		You can rest here for as long as you like, and <rest>restore any lost Stamina points</rest>.
