	The Hall of Ablution is a bit like a bathhouse except that the baths are full of sand, not water. The Uttakin purify themselves in sand as part of a religious ritual that goes back to the days when they were tribesmen in the deserts of Ankon-Konu, the southern continent. To be purified in the Hall of Ablution costs 50 Shards.
