		One of the Soulwatch hisses in a voice resonant with rage, 'Why are you not wearing your scarf, you evil blaspheming devil?'
	</p>
	<p>'But I have a scarf,' you protest, showing them your spotted scarf.</p>
	<p>
		'Aargh! You compound your foul crime by wearing a spotted scarf! On the day of the Burning of the Heretics in Hell you must wear a striped scarf! You have committed a crime of lesser heresy. You must pay a fine of 75 Shards.'
