		The blessing works by allowing you to ignore any one occasion when you would normally suffer from disease or poison, for instance, the venomous bite of a snake. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You can have only one Immunity to Disease/Poison blessing at any one time. Once it is used up, you can return to any temple of Maka to buy a new one. <goto section="142"/>.
