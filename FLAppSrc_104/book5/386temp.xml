		<i>[Weapon upgrading is currently unimplemented - sorry --Ed]</i>
		Targdaz can attempt to increase the COMBAT bonus of any one weapon that you possess. (However, note that no weapon can have a bonus higher than six). To succeed in doing so, you must roll greater than the weapon's current COMBAT bonus on two dice. If you fail, however, <random>roll the dice again</random>.
	</p>
	<outcomes>
		<outcome range="2-6">The weapon is destroyed</outcome>
		<outcome range="7-12">The weapon loses one COMBAT bonus</outcome>
	</outcomes>
	<p>When you have finished here, <goto section="245"/>.</p>
