		You clear a space, and put yourself forward as a wrestler, prepared to take on anyone. A group of masked lords and ladies strolls past, and a young masked courtier, intent on impressing his lady friend, takes up your challenge. He slams down a bag of 100 Shards as prize-money.

		The Uttakin have a long and hallowed tradition of wrestling. Wrestling is one of the few occasions during which an Uttakin can remove his mask without embarassment. Indeed, it is the only time a commoner, or an outlander can even touch a masked Uttakin. As the challenger, you are also expected to put up 100 Shards should you lose.
