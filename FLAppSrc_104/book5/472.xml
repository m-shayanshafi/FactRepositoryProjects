	The book is a history of an Uttakin folk-hero called Kizil Irmak,
	the war prophet. He was a great warrior-priest of Ebron,
	who wielded a sword called the Holy Avenger. He was slain in
	hand-to-hand combat with the High King of Old Harkuna some 500
	years ago. The High King was subsequently defeated but Kizil Irmak
	lived on in the hearts of the Uttakin as a tragic hero. His last
	resting place is said to be somewhere in north-eastern
	Old Harkuna. <goto section="30"/>
