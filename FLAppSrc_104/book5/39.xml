		Old Harkuna is governed by the Uttakin, and the border patrol consists of several middle-ranking soldier-priests. They wear strange masks, denoting their status and position within the highly stratified society of Uttaku. Uttaku is a theocracy and the laws of its god, Ebron, are followed to the letter.
