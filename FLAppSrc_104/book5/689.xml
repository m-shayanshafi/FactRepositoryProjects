		Looking down, you see a cloud of blood-red silt kicked up from the bottom of the pool, and a writhing shape within it. A dragon-shaped head and snake-like body shoot up from the water like a fountain.

		The creature, a water drake, opens its mouth and a high pressure jet of water stuns you.

			If you fail, you pass out and are drowned by the monster - <goto section="7"/>.

		If you succeed, you must fight the water drake in its own environment.

		Your own Defence score is COMBAT plus Rank only - armour will not help you against the attempts of the drake to pull you under.
