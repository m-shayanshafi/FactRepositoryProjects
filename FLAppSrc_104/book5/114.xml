		Cross off the 250 Shards. The priestess steps over to you and fixes you with a mad, staring glare. You sink into a trance during which you experience a vision.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note down this paragraph number. Now you can turn to any paragraph at random in any book in the <i>Fabled Lands</i> series that you like, and
		<sectionview random="6" title="Trance">
			read any sequence of up to six paragraphs
		</sectionview>, thus finding out what lies in store for you. What you find may not make any sense to you - well, such is the nature of oracles.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you are finished, turn back to this paragraph, where you will come out of your trance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The priestess bids you farewell with a cryptic, 'Until we meet again.'
	</p>
	<p>You leave. <goto section="101"/>.</p>
