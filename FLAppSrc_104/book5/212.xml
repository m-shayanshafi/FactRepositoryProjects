		You come across one of the country houses of a masked noble of Uttaku. You meet a noble called Hemmuwas Tamalkaya, an artificer of magic. He wears a mask shaped like a crescent moon, with a pointed forehead and pointed chin. He shows you his workshop. On a table lies a huge iron man, the golem he is working on.
