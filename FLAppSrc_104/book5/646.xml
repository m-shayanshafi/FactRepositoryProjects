		You tell the high priest of your intention to renounce Ebron as your god. His mask nearly falls from his face, he is so shocked.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Are you insane? Have you been possessed by the devils that ignorant foreigners call their gods?' he splutters. 'You will be committing a supreme heresy and your soul will be in danger!'
	</p>
	<p>
		If you still want to renounce Ebron,
		<group>
			delete Ebron from your God box
			<lose god="Ebron"/>
			<tick codeword="Erebus"/>
		</group>
		and tick the codeword <i>Erebus</i>.
		Either way, when you are ready, you leave the cathedral.
