		You have considerable influence at court. One day, a noble with blue skin, a purebred noble of the high caste, comes to see you, hoping to persuade you to use your influence to help him over a legal wrangle with another courtier.

		You can tell from his mask that he is Lord Elbistan. Once, during your less exalted days, you wrestled with him in the Grand Bazaar.

You have him right where you want him.
