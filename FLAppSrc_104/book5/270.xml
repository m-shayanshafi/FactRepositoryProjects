		You remember a story you heard in Akatsurai about a magical toad creature that lived in a swamp and used illusions to trick people. It was defeated by a sage who knew that the toad-demon had to be standing just to the left of the illusion. He cut there with his sword instead of hitting the illusion itself, and the toad-thing became visible.
	</p>
	<p>
		You try the same tactic and, sure enough, your blow strikes home. The illusion of the old woman disappears, and you are face to face with a hideous, man-sized toad demon. You must fight it.
