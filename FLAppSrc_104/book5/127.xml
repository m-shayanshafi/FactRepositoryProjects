		Your hunting skill takes you to within six feet of the unicorn, on a ledge above it. It appeares jittery, scanning the path below it for signs of danger. You seize the moment and leap down, slaying the creature with a single blow.

		Without ceremony, you wrench off the <b>unicorn's horn</b>, which you take - pausing first to wipe the blood off its tarnished rainbow surface. Note the <item name="unicorn's horn"/> on your Adventure Sheet.
