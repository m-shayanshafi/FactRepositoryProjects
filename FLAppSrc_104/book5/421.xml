		You have come to the Mixen Sumps, a flat expanse of stinking swampland, where twisted and emaciated trees drag themselves up out of the viscous, boggy, black-water marshes. Stringy reeds and bullrushes ripple in the wind, and clouds of gnats and mosquitoes fill the reeking air with a constant buzzing noise. The Ruby River loses itself amid the sludge, on its way to the sea.
