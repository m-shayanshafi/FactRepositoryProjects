		You are travelling along the road when you come to a country mansion. Outside, an ornate horse-drawn carriage is waiting. It is being loaded up with the luggage of some lord or lady, travelling to the city for a banquet or some such. You have arrived during a brief moment when no one is nearby. You notice a jewel-box lying atop a large trunk.
