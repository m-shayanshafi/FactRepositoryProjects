		The alchemist's stall is full of potions, jars of exotic substances, herbs, and so on. Alembics and beakers full of strangely coloured liquids bubble and boil.
	</p>
	<p>
		The alchemist sells potions. You can buy as many as you can afford - each one costs 50 Shards.

		A potion can be used just before any ability roll or a fight to add 1 to the relevant ability for that one roll or fight only. Each potion can be used only once, and you cannot use more than one at a time (i.e. you cannot drink six potions and add 6 to your roll).
