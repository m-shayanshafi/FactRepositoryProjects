	<p>
		You tell the crowd a story about a dog who saved the life of a saint of the Church of Ebron, and how ever since then, the dog has been sacred to Ebron. Then you tell an irreverent joke about over-zealous priests, and the crowd's blood-lust is turned to laughter. The priest is booed, and sent on his way.
	</p>
	<p>
		The shepherd who owns the dog is grateful and he gives you some tips on wilderness lore.
