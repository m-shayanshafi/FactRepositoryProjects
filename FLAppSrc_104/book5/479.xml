		The advocate tells you that there is only one certain way of avoiding a conviction by the arbiters - by not appearing in court at all!
	</p>
	<p>
		'There are two way this may be achieved,' he says. 'The first is to choose trial by bokh. Even foreigners may elect this revered, and time-honoured method. Bokh is an ancient and holy game, and you will have to play against one of the court-appointed master of bokh. I advise this course only if you are well versed in the intricacies of the game. The second is to pay a large inducement to the arbiters. Four hundred Shards will guarantee a favourable outcome.'
