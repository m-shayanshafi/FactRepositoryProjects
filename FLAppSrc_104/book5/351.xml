	Becoming an initiate of Maka gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services the temple can offer. It costs 50 Shards to become an initiate. You cannot become an initiate of Maka if you are already an initiate of another temple.

			If you choose to become an initiate,

				<tick god="Maka"/>
				<lose shards="50"/>
