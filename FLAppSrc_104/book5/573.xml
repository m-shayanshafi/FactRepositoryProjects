		The Three Fortunes are the goddesses of fate who weave the tapestry of all men's lives. A placard outside the temple declares: 'O Lucky Spatterdash, blessed by the Three Fortunes with freedom!'
	</p>
	<p>
		Inside, a vast wall-painting shows a three-faced deity with six limbs hurling down nuggets of gold at a host of masked demons, who run in terror at her wrath. The high priestess welcomes you as the instrument of the goddesses' revenge against the hated Uttakin.
