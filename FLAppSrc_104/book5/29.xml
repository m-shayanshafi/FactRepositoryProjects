		Spatterdash is a grey and dismal place. Pasty-faced peasants, gaunt and thin from their poor diet, stumble across the cobbled streets. Old women struggle under heavy loads of wood, and the children stare morosely at you from dark-rimmed eyes full of despair. Nearly all the local produce is taken in taxes to feed the decadent Court of Hidden Faces in Aku.
