		The troll grunts and says, 'It's those damnable priests of the Church of Ebron. They're always passing through and kicking up a fuss about holy days, heresy and suchlike. You have to wear a spotted scarf or a striped scarf on such and such a day, and I don't know what. It's not as if they mind me ripping travellers off for a few Shards, it's sticking to their holy rules that they get uptight about! And those Soulwatch guys - phew! - they're worse than the toughest knight. So I wear all this gear so as not to upset them. Anyways, you paying the toll or what?'
