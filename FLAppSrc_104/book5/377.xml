		You spy movement in the craggy heights above - you start, fearing ambush. The creature above you is no assailant, however. You take it at first for a brilliant white horse, until you catch sight of a scintillating rainbow horn, jutting proudly from the unicorn's forehead. Legends say that the horn of a unicorn is a cure for any ill, and a potent ward against magic.
