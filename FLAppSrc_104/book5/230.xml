		You step into a huge library, known as the Archives of the Blue. Here you find the Master of the Documents of Fable, a little old man with a mask covered in strange sigils. The mask is so big that he has trouble holding up his head.
	</p>
	<p>
		He tells you about the Grand Telling, a ceremonial competition held every year at court in which the courtier who can come up with the best story wins. The master wants you to write your life story.
	</p>
	<p>
		'You adventurers always come up with the most extraordinary tales. Write me a real blockbuster, of suitable length, and I'll use it to win the Grand Telling. In return, I'll see that you are rewarded. You have eight weeks to complete your story. I expect you to work here, in the archives, so I can keep an eye on you.'
	</p>
	<p>You reckon it should take about four to five weeks to finish.</p>
