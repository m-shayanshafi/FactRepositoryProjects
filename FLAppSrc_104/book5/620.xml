		Unfortunately, you have been infected with a disease from an insect bite. Note that you have the
		<disease name="Red Ague">
			<effect ability="combat" bonus="-1"/>
			<effect ability="charisma" bonus="-1"/>
		</disease> (causing a blotchy rash that itches like the devil). Reduce your COMBAT and CHARISMA by one until you can find a cure. Ignore this if you have a blessing of Immunity from Disease/Poison (but don't forget to cross off the blessing).
