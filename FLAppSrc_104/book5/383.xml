		The heat is searing. <lose stamina="1d">Lose 1-6 points of Stamina</lose>. Inside the crater you see something moving! Suddenly, out of the steam and smoke, a flickering creature of living lightning throws itself at you. It is a storm demon, one of the riders of thunderclouds that delight in causing havoc among mortals - it has come to earth, flying on a meteor of selenium ore. Its flashing, coruscating body is hard to strike.
