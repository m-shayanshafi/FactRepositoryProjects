		You have an uneasy feeling - a gnawing in the pit of your stomach. You feel your throat tighten - an avenging ghost, the hangman of the Shadar, has caught up with you after your desecration of the tombs in the Crags of the Long Homes! A tall shadow approaches you. You know that unless you lift this curse, this will not be the last time he attacks. You must fight.

			Each time the hangman strikes you, do not lose Stamina - instead, subtract 1 point from one of your abilities permanently (<random dice="1" var="A">roll one die</random> to choose which one;

				<lose ability="charisma" amount="1" fatal="t">

			If any ability falls to zero, you have paid the ultimate price - death - for your sacrilege.

		If you defeat the hangman, the tightening around your throat eases - but not fully. Will you ever be rid of the hangman? Now <return>turn back</return> to the paragraph you noted.
