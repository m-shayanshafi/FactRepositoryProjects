		You remember an old technique for making an enchanted cloak from the skin of a giant chameleon. After a few hours of ritual magic, you have created a
		<tool name="chameleon cloak" ability="thievery" bonus="3" sell="500"/>.
		<!-- originally I had this as a magical (bonus) effect, then
		I reread the rules; no particular reason to treat the bonus
		as cumulative, so now it's another tool -->
		Note it on your Adventure Sheet, and that you can sell it at any market for 500 Shards.
