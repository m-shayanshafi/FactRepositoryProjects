		You are brought before a panel of three Arbiters of the Word of Ebron. They sit on a raised dais, dressed in bright yellow robes covered in a pattern of cornflower blue symbols. Each wears a different mask - one a lion's head (retribution), another the dove (forgiveness), and the last is fashioned like the sun (wisdom on high). They cross-examine you in some depth.
