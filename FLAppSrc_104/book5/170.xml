		The Red Garden is where the Uttakin dispose of their criminals, heretics and people they just don't like. The condemned are thrown into the large sunken garden, and the suckered tendrils of the man-eating, carnivorous alalakh plants that flourish in the pit drain them of their blood, and dissolve their flesh. The leaves, barbed vines and strange, bulbous, mushroom-shaped flowers glisten redly in the sun, pulsing with the blood of their victims.
	</p>
	<p>
		A wire fence has been erected around the top of the pit. Masked lords and ladies of the court amble around the edge, taking an unholy pleasure in the grisly executions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, it is your turn to taste the tendrils of alalakh, as the saying goes. You are shoved into the garden, and you plummet head-first on to a large, fat, melon-like fruit of one of the plants. It explodes, spraying fresh blood into the air.
