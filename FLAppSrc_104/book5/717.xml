		The book is the work of a man called Agrash the Explorer. You learn that the underworld is the name for the shadowy realm of the creatures like the trau, and of demons and the dead - in short, Hell itself. It has many names - the Land of Roots, the Place of Direful Dreams, the Land Beyond the Dark Mirror and suchlike. There are several ways in. There is rumoured to be a stairway to the underworld on the other side of the Peaks at the Edge of the World, far to the north. Sailors say you can sail into the underworld through the cave known as the Mouth of Harkun, north of Yarimura. The monks of Noboro monastery claim you can walk into the underworld from Akatsurai, simply by always heading in a north-easterly direction. Scholars of Dweomer claim an entrance lies at the very top of the peak on Starspike Island. Also, the tunnels of the trau are thought to lead inexorably downward, into the Realm of Shadows. The end of the book refers to volume two in the series, How to get out of the Underworld.
