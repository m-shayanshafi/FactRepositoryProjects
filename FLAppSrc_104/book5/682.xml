	You are travelling across north-west Uttaku. The countryside is rocky and sparse; it is largely uninhabited save for the occasional goatherd. You spot a squat tower of red stone in a field. It appears to be floating a couple of inches off the ground. A sign leans drunkenly nearby. It reads, written in a crazed scrawl: 'The House of Holyamu the Unbidden. Visitors welcome (to buzz off!).'
