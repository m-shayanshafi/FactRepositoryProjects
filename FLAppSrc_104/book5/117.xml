		You hear an ominous rustling in the branches overhead. Looking up, you spot a pair of bulbous eyes swivelling round towards you. It is a giant chameleon - a creature at least twelve feet long - its skin as green and mottled as the forest itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		It spits out its long, thick tongue, trying to suck you into its massive jaws. You dodge aside, but trip on some brambles and fall on to a pile of rotting gurul fruit.
