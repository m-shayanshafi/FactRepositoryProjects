		You are restored to life at the war-god's chapel in the High King's castle. Your Stamina is back to normal. The <lose item="*">possessions</lose> and <lose shards="*">cash</lose> you were carrying at the time of your death are lost. Cross them off your Adventure Sheet. Also remember to delete the entry in the Resurrection box now it has been used.
	</p>
	<p>
		The high priest, pale and wan after the effort of resurrecting you says, 'Tyrnai has granted you another chance - seek to do battle in the name of the High King, for he is the chosen one of mighty Tyrnai!'
