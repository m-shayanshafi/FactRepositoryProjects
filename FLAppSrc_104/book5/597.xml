		Hundreds of years ago, the Uttakin were a tribe inhabiting the Blue Grasslands and the Desert of Bones of Ankon-Konu. They united under the banner of Ebron and their first king, Ammunas the Baptizer. The Uttakin struggled with another tribe, the Golden Men, for dominance. The Uttakin began to get the upper hand, until the Golden Men started using flying chariots, known as arkships. How they came to use these ships is unclear - all you learn is that the arkships were powered by the magical ore selenium. The Uttakin were defeated and driven out of Ankon-Konu. They sailed across the Violet Ocean, and invaded Harkuna, where they overthrew the people there, and re-established their ancient kingdom, renaming the land Uttaku.
