<!-- a tricky section, because it contains an optional ability roll.
     Even after the user has rolled, they can choose one of the other options.
     I could separate this choice to roll into another sub-section, but for now
     I'll leave at as is and see if anyone complains. -->
     
	<p>
		You are beside the Rese River, which divides Old Harkuna from Golnir.
		A barge here conveys passengers over to the east bank of the Rese and
		the town of Marmorek, in Golnir, at a cost of 1 Shard.
		<if book="2">
		Alternatively you can swim across by
		    <difficulty ability="scouting" level="12" force="f">
		        making a SCOUTING roll at a Difficulty of 12
		    </difficulty>. (The current is strong, and the water icy cold.)
		</if>
		Or you can head into Old Harkuna.
