		The ghoul arrives at midnight, poking its grey face in through the window of the room where the dead girl is lying. You watch from behind a door as it creeps inside, but as soon as it so much as licks the corpse it recoils with an agonized shriek and flees off into the night.

	<p>
		The next day you find it dead in front of its lair, poisoned by the holy aura you laid on the corpse. Inside the lair you find a jar of
		<item name="faery mead"/> and
		<gain shards="250"/>.
		You can also take the
		<item name="ghoul's head"><b>ghoul&#8217;s head</b></item>
		as a trophy if you want. Note anything you are taking on your Adventure Sheet and <goto section="53"/>.
