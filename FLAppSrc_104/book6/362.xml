	Shingen is a quiet seaside town where the Lord Chancellor has
	his private residence. There is no mistaking the building: a
	sprawling mansion of polished cedarwood with scarlet gonfalons
	streaming from the eaves. It sits on a hillside, glaring down on
	the town like a tiger sunning itself on a rock.
