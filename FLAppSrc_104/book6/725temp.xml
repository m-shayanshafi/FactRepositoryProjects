			If you wish to become an initiate of the Sage of Peace, the monks will instruct you in the sacred doctrine. To comprehend this doctrine requires
			<difficulty ability="sanctity" level="15" force="f">
				a SANCTITY roll of Difficulty 15
			</difficulty>.
			<success>
				Success means you are
				<tick title="Initiate of the Sage of Peace">made an initiate</tick>.
			</success>
		</if>
		The monks are open-minded and don&#8217;t mind if you were already an initiate of another god; you can be both.
	</p>
	<p>
		<failure>
			If you attempt the SANCTITY roll and fail it, the doctrine is so confusing that you must
			<lose ability="sanctity" amount="1">
				lose 1 from your SANCTITY score
			</lose>.
		</failure>
		(You can renounce initiate status freely at any time.)
