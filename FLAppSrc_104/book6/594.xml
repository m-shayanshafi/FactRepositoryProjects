	A long wooden bridge supported by heavy wooden pilings
	stretches across the Chu River. A woman in warrior&#8217;s garb
	awaits you at the halfway point, announcing herself as the
	daughter of Lord Chudaifu of the Black Swan Clan. Apparently
	she wishes to test her martial prowess against you - she has
	drawn her sword and stepped out to block your path.
