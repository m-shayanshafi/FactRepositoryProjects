		Yoritomo clasps you by the hand - a signal honour from a lord of such exalted rank. In front of his surviving guards he gives you the title Hatamoto.
		<tick title="Hatamoto">Note this</tick> on your Adventure Sheet.
		It means that you have the right to wear the Moonrise Clan&#8217;s livery and to act as the Shogun&#8217;s emissary.

		&#8216;Come to visit me soon in Mukogawa,&#8217; says Yoritomo as he sets off.
