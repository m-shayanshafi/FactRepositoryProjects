		An object resembling a giant paper lantern comes drifting over the fields. Intermittently it gives off a gleam of fiery yellow light. As it descends you can make out a man in wizard&#8217;s robes standing in a basket slung underneath the lantern, conjuring gouts of flame that he sends shooting up inside it.

	<p>The strange craft bumps to a landing on a nearby hillock.</p>

		&#8216;Hallo,&#8217; calls the occupant of the basket. &#8216;Want a lift anywhere?&#8217;
