		You get up in the night feeling thirsty. Stumbling out to the stream behind the cottage, you catch sight of a scraggly creature with luminous grey flesh and red eyes loping down the path from the clifftop.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Take this stranger!&#8217; cries out a voice from behind you. &#8216;Just leave our daughter&#8217;s body untouched!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		It is the old man and his wife. They invited you to stay overnight so that the ghoul would devour you rather than the corpse of their daughter.
