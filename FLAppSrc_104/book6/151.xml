		You are accosted by the side of the street by a blind man who stares at you with milky-white eyes. &#8216;Travel straight to the woods from here,&#8217; he hisses in a tone of great urgency. &#8216;Go upstream and look for a door under an old oak. Take the left-hand path.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		He veers off, tapping the boardwalk with his cane, and is lost in the crowd. A strange encounter.
