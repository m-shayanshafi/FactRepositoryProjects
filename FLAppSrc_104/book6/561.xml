		The door swings open, releasing a gust of thick foul air. You are confronted by a face that almost fills the doorway. A lumpish skull covered with warty hide sits between shoulders as wide as a log. Muscles like huge sacks of flour strain in a torso weighed down with fat and hair. Then the giant opens his mouth to speak, and all of sudden you know where that smell is coming from.
