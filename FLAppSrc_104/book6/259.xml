	The tengu king cannot teach you anything more at this time.
	He gives orders for his elite guard, the Leaflet Knights, to escort
	you safely to the edge of his domain. Though reaching the

	the space of seven wingbeats. As you turn to thank your escort,
	you see only seven big black crows flapping off into the woods.
