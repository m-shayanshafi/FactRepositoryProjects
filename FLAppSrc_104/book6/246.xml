	Akatsurai is known as the Land of a Thousand Gods. The people
	revere a vast pantheon that ranges from the great celestial spirits
	such as Juntoku, Lord of War, down to little hearth gods and
	deities of the rocks and streams. On almost every street corner
	there is a shrine. You go into one and the priest asks how he can
	be of service.
