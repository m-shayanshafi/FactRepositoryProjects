		By dint of intrigue, the artful Masayori has managed to raise himself to the position of minister of the interior. You run across him in the bark-roofed colonnade that leads from the outer palace to the rock garden.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Ah, if it isn&#8217;t our foreign friend,&#8217; he says in a tone like over-sugared sherbet.
	</p>
	<p>You give the briefest of greetings and try to move past.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;A moment of your time, if you please. Lately the Sovereign&#8217;s rest has been disturbed by an evil creature that descends by night to perch on the palace roof. Someone has to be found who can destroy this creature, and I took the liberty of putting your name forward.&#8217; He gives you a wide smile, reminiscent of a cat who has the key to the canary&#8217;s cage.
