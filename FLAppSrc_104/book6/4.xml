		One of the guards catches up with you a few streets away from the palace. &#8216;You are a merchant?&#8217; he demands in an imperious voice. &#8216;I am interested in western styles of armour and would like to purchase any stock you might have.&#8217;

	<p>
		It is beneath his dignity to haggle, so you are able to strike a good bargain.

		The only drawback is that he insists on buying all the armour you have on you - including any you happen to be wearing! If you sell him all your suits of armour, add the money to your Adventure Sheet and <goto section="79" force="f"/>. If you refuse to sell him everything, <goto section="55"/>. <i>[Decide how honest you want to be --Ed]</i>
