<section name="Abraxas the Seeker" profession="Priest">
	<p>
		Although Abraxas has a strong spiritual sense, he questions whether the gods should be regarded as morally superior to mankind merely because they created the universe. His quest is for a religion that transcends man and the gods and instead aims for a single all-embracing truth. He believes he will find this in Akatsurai.
