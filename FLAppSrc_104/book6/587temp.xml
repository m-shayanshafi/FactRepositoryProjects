		The shrine is lit by hundreds of candles, each illuminating a tiny niche in which there is a statue of a different god. You can make an offering of
		<lose shards="25" price="x"/>
		if you wish, in which case
		<random dice="1" flag="x"/>
		to see what response you get. If you roll a blessing that you already have then the offering is wasted, because you can only have one blessing at a time of each type.
