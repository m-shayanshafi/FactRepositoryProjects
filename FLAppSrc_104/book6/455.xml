		You meet an actor who wishes to return to the town where he was born, to see his aged mother. &#8216;But I have not had much success in my chosen profession,&#8217; he explains. &#8216;If my mother sees me in these poor rags she will die a disappointed woman. I don&#8217;t want her last thoughts to be full of worry for my future.&#8217;

		He offers to sell you his only possession, a finely made dragon mask. He will not sell for less than 100 Shards, and obviously would not normally even go as low as that.
