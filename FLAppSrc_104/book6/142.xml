		This time you are completely transformed into a dragon. You become very powerful indeed, but the bad news is that you forget all about your previous life as a human being. Perhaps when you lie curled up in your cave you will sometimes dream of a time when you were human, but when you awaken to slay the adventurers who disturb you those memories will soon fade.
