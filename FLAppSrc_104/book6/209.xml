		At the back of a cliff-lined bay on Udai Island stands a shrine dedicated to the worship of the Moonrise Clan&#8217;s ancestral spirits.
	</p>
	<p>
		Priests in white robes come down to the beach to meet you. They are armed with moon spades - poles with a shovel-shaped blade on one end, a scythe on the other. Their vows are supposed to prohibit them from shedding blood, but they will fight to defend the shrine.
