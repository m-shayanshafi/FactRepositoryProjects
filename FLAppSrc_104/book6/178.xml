	Mukogawa is a city of strong gleaming ramparts built on cliffs
	overlooking the sea. White banners flutter and snap in the
	breeze and soldiers in white surcoats patrol the streets. This is the
	stronghold of the Moonrise Clan, whose ancestral shrine is just
	across the straits on Udai Island.
