		You traverse a flower-filled valley towards a ridge of sombre pine trees. Arriving at a stream, you are about to cross when you notice that a large lump in mid-stream that you had mistaken for a boulder is actually the head of an enormous river serpent. You were just about to use it as a stepping stone.
