		If you already own a ship you can sell it for half these prices. If you do buy a ship, record its details on the Ship&#8217;s Manifest. The crew quality is average, but you can
		<buy crew="good" shards="75">upgrade it to good</buy>
		for 75 Shards and
		<buy crew="excellent" shards="150">to excellent</buy>
