		The abbot explains the sage&#8217;s teaching. &#8216;To achieve enlightenment you must free yourself from desire,&#8217; he says.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Surely a person without desire is merely apathetic?&#8217;</p>

		He shakes his head. &#8216;The force of your spirit is like a wild horse that pulls you headlong. You must tame this horse so that you can ride it. The essence of the sage&#8217;s teaching is to make you a whole person.&#8217;
