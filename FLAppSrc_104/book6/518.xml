		&#8216;What do those characters mean that are written along the side?&#8217; you ask him.

		Record the details of your ship on the Ship&#8217;s Manifest; you can name her if you wish. Remember to cross off the cost from the money recorded on your Adventure Sheet. The crew quality is average. Each time you arrive at a new destination, remember to change the entry in the Docked column. Currently, of course, the ship is docked at Chambara.
