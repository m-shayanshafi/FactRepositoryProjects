		Instead of attacking you, the wasps turn on the evil wizard. There are so many that the noise is deafening. The wizard has no defence and is soon lying dead on the veranda of his mansion. The wasps rise into the air and go swarming off to the north-east.

	<p>
		Inside the mansion you find a
		<tool name="celestium wand" ability="magic" bonus="5"/>,
		a <item name="fretwork key"/>,
		a <item name="green gem"/>,
		a <item name="scarab amulet"/>
		and a bottle of <item name="faery mead"/>.
		Take anything you want and
		<tick codeword="Faded">get the codeword Faded</tick>,
		then <goto section="44"/>.
