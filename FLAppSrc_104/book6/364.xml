		While your men go off to replenish the water supplies and catch a few birds, you stretch out under a shelf of rock. The lulling sound of the waves makes you feel sleepy, but just when you&#8217;re on the point of dozing off, a paladin in black and yellow livery appears and greets you in the name of his queen.
	</p>
	<p>
		You look around for your men. They are not in sight. The paladin asks you to accompany him to see his queen.
