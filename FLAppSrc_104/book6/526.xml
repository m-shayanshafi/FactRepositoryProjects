	You have a horrid dream that three disembodied heads come
	flying over the moor while you are asleep and start to devour
	you from the feet up. You half wake, feeling warm and numb as
	though you have been drugged. The heads look up with gory
	grins, then resume their meal. What is left of you goes back to
	sleep.
