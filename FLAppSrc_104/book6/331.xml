	Inside the shrine there are many white cocoons strung high up
	in the recesses above the rafters. Some are wrapped around
	nothing but desiccated bones, others contain dead bodies well-preserved
	by the venom that slew them. You also find a
	<weapon name="warhammer" bonus="4"/>, a suit of
	<armour name="splint armour" bonus="4"/> and
	<gain shards="660"/>.
	When you have taken whatever you want and perhaps said a quick prayer, you can leave:
	<goto section="398"/>.
