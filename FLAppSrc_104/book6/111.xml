	You come to a shrine gateway that stands close to the outskirts
	of Kwaidan Forest. Dawn sunlight is turning the morning mist
	to gold dust and the trees to faded watercolours, but strangely
	there are no birds singing. You look in through the gate. The
	courtyard is filled with long grass and weeds. The shrine
	buildings look derelict and overgrown. Then you notice a man
	standing on the porch of the main shrine.
