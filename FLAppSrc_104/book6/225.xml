		He tells a story about a poor knight whose wife became inexplicably ill. He roamed far and wide searching for a cure and finally encountered an old hermit who told him that he should search for a dragon, because all dragons have a magical pearl in the roof of their mouth. The hermit claimed that such a pearl was the only thing that could heal the knight&#8217;s wife.

	<p>
		Eventually, after many adventures, the knight encountered the dragon and slew it. He then discovered that the hermit had been the dragon in human form. It had cursed the knight&#8217;s wife because of an old feud with her family. After the dragon&#8217; s death the curse was lifted, the wife recovered, and they lived happily ever after on the fortune they got for selling the magic pearl.
