	Because the House of Wistaria is related to the royal family, they
	especially revere the goddess Nisoderu, spirit of the sun, who is
	believed to be the first ancestor of the Sovereign. Her shrine is
	in the east garden of the mansion. Two painted screens that
	show the veiled goddess arising from the cavern of night slides
	back to give entry to the inner chapel, a room whose bare
	wooden floor and walls have been polished until they gleam like
	red gold.
