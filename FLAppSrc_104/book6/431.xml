	You enter a glade where an old tree has toppled. Beetles scurry
	across it, burrowing into the dead wood, and a profusion of
	brightly stained flowers have taken root in the bark. On all sides
	of the clearing there are saplings stretching hopefully up towards
	the bare patch of sky, engaged in a slow, silent and deadly
	competition to be the fallen tree&#8217;s replacement.
