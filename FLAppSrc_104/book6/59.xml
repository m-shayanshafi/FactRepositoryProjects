		Chompo is the stronghold of the Northern Wistaria Clan, whose dominance of this region is so well-established that it is virtually the clan&#8217;s private kingdom.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike most of the southern cities, the central district of Chompo is enclosed by high fortifications built of round timbers. Within are the homes of the aristocrats: austere but imposing mansions that lie in a curve around the hillside. Outside this stockade are the humbler dwellings of merchants and craftsmen.
