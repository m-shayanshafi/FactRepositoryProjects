	You stand on an outcrop of rock and survey the majestically
	inhospitable moorland that stretches to the horizon in all
	directions. In the north hovers a smudge of violet shadow that
	marks the high expanse of the Kwaidan Forest. Westwards, by
	your reckoning, the Moku River flows down into Kotobuki
	Bay. Far to the south runs the Great Saddle Road, while the east
	is open country as far as the sea.
