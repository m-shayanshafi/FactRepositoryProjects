		Kaiju is a charming fishing town of smart villas with low-pitched roof climbing a hillside tufted with feathery pine trees. The Shi River cascades down through the town in a spectacular waterfall where, according to legend, the god Sanobu paused to wash his feet after traversing the lost lands of the east. Kaiju is the town of which a famous poet wrote:
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Blue like smoke under rails of spring rain,</p>
	<p>The town where my heart dwells</p>
	<p>Is surely half in the next world.&#8217;</p>
