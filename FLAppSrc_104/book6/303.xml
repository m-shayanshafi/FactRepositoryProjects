		The mourners take no notice when you step out among them. At first you think they are overwhelmed by grief; but then it dawns on you that they really can&#8217;t see you. You reach out to touch one, but your hand passes straight through him.

		&#8216;I&#8217;m afraid they can&#8217;t see you because you&#8217;re dead,&#8217; says a voice. You turn to see a little fat priest standing there. &#8216;You died of exposure seven nights ago,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and since you&#8217;re a stranger in the district we&#8217;ve had to go to the expense of burying you.&#8217;
