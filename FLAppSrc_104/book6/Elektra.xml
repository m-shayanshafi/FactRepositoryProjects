<section name="Elektra Nemora" profession="Troubadour">
	<p>
		Elektra always has a sweet song on her lips to charm the people she meets. She believes all conflict is best settled by compromise, an attitude that makes her a natural diplomat and peacekeeper. As well as helping to calm the tense military situation in Akatsurai, she would like to play music at the court of the sovereign - a signal honour for a travelling minstrel.
