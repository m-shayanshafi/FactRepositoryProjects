		The only place you can find to stay is a tiny rat-infested garret above a noisy tavern. At night the room fills with smoke from the taproom below, and the roof lets in the rain, the innkeeper wants
		<lose shards="1" price="x">1 Shard a day</lose>
		for this hovel. Each day you spend here,
		<random dice="1" flag="x" var="y">roll a die</random>.
		<if var="y" lessthan="6">
			On a score of 1-5 you can
			<rest stamina="1">regain 1 Stamina point</rest> if injured,
			<lose flag="x" hidden="t"/>
		</if>
		<else>
			but on a roll of 6 you get dysentery and
			<lose stamina="1">lose 1 Stamina</lose>.
			<lose flag="x" hidden="t"/>
		</else>
		When you are ready to leave, settle your bill and then <goto section="8"/>.
