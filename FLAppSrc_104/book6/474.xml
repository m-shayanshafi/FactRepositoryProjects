		Kiyomori and his retinue could not be more astonished if a faery creature from the overworld had just fallen into their midst. Jiro, the chancellor&#8217;s executioner, rests the tip of his two-handed sword on the turf and shakes his head.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Now what do you think you&#8217;re up to?&#8217; he says.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Who is this fool?&#8217; demands Kiyomori. &#8216;Jiro, execute them both.&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		Jiro hefts his sword and steps closer. Two other guards are moving to get behind you.
