		The horsemen chase you for miles across the nebulous landscape. To escape their stinging spears you are forced to abandon every possession and all the money you are carrying. At last you lose your tormentors in a bank of fog. Their excited cries and the fierce snorts of their steeds gradually recede into the distance. The aftermath of your ordeal leaves you miserable and trembling, glad to have got away with your life.
