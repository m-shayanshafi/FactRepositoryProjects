		Knocking at a narrow green door, you are admitted to a muddy courtyard where a beautiful lady sits with a flute in her lap. She calls you up on to the veranda beside her and listens without surprise as you tell your tale.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;I knew my lord would find me!&#8217; she says. &#8216;But you must explain to him that I cannot return to court. I say this for his own good. The Lord Chancellor bears a grudge against me, and it is dangerous to antagonize him.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		You listen with a frown, suspecting that it would not go well for you if you returned to the palace empty-handed. You must try your best to convince her to come with you.
