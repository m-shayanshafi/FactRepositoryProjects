		The Chu River is spanned by a wooden bridge. It creaks slightly as you set out across it. At the mid-point you are stopped by a female warrior who wears maroon armour over a tunic of black and scarlet silk. She tells you she belongs to the extensive Black Swan family, whose members are famous for their martial prowess.

	<p>
		&#8216;If you wish to cross the bridge you must face me in a duel,&#8217; she says.
