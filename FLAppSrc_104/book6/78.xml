		Your blank features will startle and horrify anyone you meet. The only remedy is to wear a <b>mask</b> if you have one. Any sort of mask will do: a <b>courtier&#8217;s mask</b>, <b>dragon mask</b>, etc. People might think it odd that you go about masked, but it is better than scaring them witless.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not have a mask you will automatically fail any CHARISMA roll from now on.
		<tick ability="charisma" effect="+cursed">
			Put your CHARISMA score in brackets
		</tick>
		and make a note beside it that you cannot use CHARISMA as long as you have no mask.
