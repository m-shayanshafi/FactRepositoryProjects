	It is a poor old friar who has been hit on the head and robbed.
	You help him up and see that he is well enough to continue on
	his way to Narai. In return for your kindness he gives you a
	blessing. Write <gain blessing="luck"/>
	in the Blessings box on your Adventure
	Sheet. The blessing can be used once to allow you to reroll any
	dice result. After using the blessing, remember to cross it off
	your Adventure Sheet. You can have only one Luck blessing at
	a time, so if you had one already the only thing the old friar can
	give you is his gratitude. <goto section="671"/>.
