	You see a richly attired gentleman strutting down the street at a
	very smart pace for someone with such a dignified appearance.
	His eyes are fixed straight ahead of him and his stern expression
	as he brushes past is enough to deter you from saying anything.
	As you watch him go bobbing down the street, you notice a
	ticket sticking up out of his hat. Has he forgotten to remove the
	price tag? If so, and he is on his way to the palace, he could
	suffer serious embarrassment.
