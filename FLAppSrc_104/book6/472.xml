	The Black Pagoda is a seven-storeyed tower set above sheer cliffs
	where the sea crashes furiously against the rocks, sending up
	high spouts of white foam. The stone from which the pagoda is
	built was reputedly quarried from the doorway of hell itself. Its
	colour is so deep a black that the pagoda looks like a hole in
	space.
