		The giant slams the door shut on your leg, causing you the loss of
		<lose stamina="1d">1-6 Stamina points</lose>
		and trapping you while he slams punishing punches into your gut. He knows how to maim, and any Stamina points you lose in this fight are permanently lost!
	</p>
	<fight name="Giant" combat="15" defence="22" stamina="51" abilityDamaged="stamina"/>
	<p>
		Remember to keep track of each time he injures you and reduce your unwounded Stamina score by that amount if you survive the fight. If, somehow, you defeat him, <goto section="458"/>.
		<!-- does this mean that if character is killed, then
		     resurrected, Stamina loss is not permanent? -->
