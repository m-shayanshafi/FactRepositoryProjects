		You fall asleep under a tree and dream about huge black birds that live in the middle of the woods and teach tricks of magic and martial arts to a few favoured travellers. One of the birds offers to trade a magic lodestone that will help you find them.

	<p>
		When you wake up, you find that a
		<tool name="compass" ability="scouting" bonus="1"/>
		has replaced one of the items in your knapsack.
		<random dice="1" var="x"/> and the result is the number of
		<lose itemAt="x">the item replaced</lose>,
		counting from the first (e.g. if you roll a 3, the third item listed on your Adventure Sheet is replaced). If you roll a number that does not correspond to an item on your Adventure Sheet then you get the compass without losing anything.
