	Three great roads converge on Mukogawa, but the two leading
	west are seldom travelled these days because of the hostility that
	exists between the lords of the Moonrise Clan and the official
	government of Lord Kiyomori. The third road goes north to
	Chompo, where the Wistaria Clan rules in ancient splendour.
