	The Sage of Peace bestows blessings on his initiates for free.
	Write <tick blessing="luck"/> in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet. The
	blessing can be used once to allow you to reroll any dice result.
	After using the blessing, remember to cross it off your
	Adventure Sheet. You can have only one Luck blessing at a
	time. When you are through at the temple, <goto section="155"/>.
