		To obtain a blessing you must
		<group>
			<text>pay 45 Shards and make a CHARISMA roll at a Difficulty of 14</text>
			<lose shards="45"/>
			<difficulty ability="charisma" level="14">
				<adjust profession="wayfarer" amount="4"/>
			</difficulty>
		</group>
		(or Difficulty 10 if you&#8217;re a Wayfarer).
		<success>
			On a successful roll you get a blessing of
			<tick blessing="travel"/>
			which you can write in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet. This blessing allows you to reroll the dice once when travelling to a new region, so as to avoid an encounter. You can only have one Safe Travel blessing at a time. When it is used, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You will then need to come back here to get another one.
