		Your prayers are answered; Akugenda&#8217;s vengeful ghost is snuffed out leaving only a wisp of brown smoke and the acrid smell of ozone.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kiyomori looks at his men, most of whom are crouching back in terror, and then at you, standing boldly with your hand upraised to ward off evil.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Come down to my villa,&#8217; he says. &#8216;We&#8217;ll have supper.&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		You spend a pleasant evening dining on the veranda, which gives a majestic view out to sea. You have done well for yourself making friends with Kiyomori; he is the most powerful man in the country.
