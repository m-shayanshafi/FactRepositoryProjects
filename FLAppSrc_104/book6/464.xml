		Like any knight of Akatsurai you are expected to live simply. Your room contains only a pallet, a low table, and two floor cushions. A maid has left a single flower in a celadon vase.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can rest from your adventures here,
		<rest>restoring your Stamina to normal</rest> if wounded.
	</p>
	<p>
		Possessions and money can be left without fear of robbery; just record them in the box below.
	</p>
	<p>When you are ready to leave, <goto section="553"/>.</p>
