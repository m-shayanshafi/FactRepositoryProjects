		She's easy to miss, this slip of a girl clad all in black, with her voice like a wisp of silk. Then you miss your hoard of gold or silver too; when you look for Shikibu she's no longer there. She is determined to obtain the antique <b>golden katana</b> kept in the Imperial Palace in Chambara - and nothing will stop her.

		You can play as Shikibu, or as a rogue with a different name (enter it in the 'Name' field). To begin your adventure, <goto section="1" force="f"/>.
