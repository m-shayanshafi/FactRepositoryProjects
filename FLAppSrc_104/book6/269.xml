		Overtaken by nightfall on a deserted hillside, you take shelter in a ramshackle barn. You are so weary after your travels that the straw feels as comfortable as a feather bed, and in spite of the raw wind outside you are soon fast asleep.
	</p>
	<p>
		You wake in pitch darkness. The sound of bells and hushed voices is what must have woken you. Crawling to the door of the barn, you look out on a sombre moonlit scene. A group of mourners in ceremonial white stoles have set down a coffin right outside. &#8216;We&#8217;ll just rest a bit before going on,&#8217; you overhear someone say.
