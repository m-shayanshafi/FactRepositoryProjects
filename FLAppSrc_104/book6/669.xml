		About two hours after midnight, just as the moon has risen, a black cloud comes drifting from the woods west of the city and hovers over the roof of the palace. At the same time a baleful influence can be felt settling over everything like a chill wind from a graveyard. Peering into the depths of the cloud, you are sure you can make out a monstrous squirming shape.
