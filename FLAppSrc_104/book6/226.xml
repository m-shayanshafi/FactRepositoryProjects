		Built over a network of canals, Hagashin presents a very different appearance from the cities of the north. Tall conical towers rear above the rooftops, clad in gold leaf and adorned with sweeping spikes and long bronze bells, making the skyline seem ablaze in the sunlight. The bridges that span the canals are supported by fierce statues of demons that stand waist-deep in the green water. Tall porticoes enclosed by filigree screens front each building, so that as you walk along a street you catch glimpses of silhouettes watching from the verandas on either side.
