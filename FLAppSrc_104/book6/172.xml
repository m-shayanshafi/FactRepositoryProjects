		A shopkeeper gives you directions, but you take a wrong turn and get lost in a derelict part of the city. There is no one to ask the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the time you find your way to the palace gates it is nearly dark. Curiously, there are no guards on duty. Peering inside the gate, you see a garden filling with purple dusk and a solitary lamp burning in a gazebo surrounded by ivy-strung trellises. The main buildings of the palace are plunged in darkness.
