		You emerge from the maze into a passage that leads to a small funnel-shaped chamber. Peering out from behind a cleft in the rock, you see five grotesque warriors guarding a book that rests between them on a jewelled lectern. They are staring fiercely in all directions, alert and ready to deal with any interloper.
