		If you decide to buy it, cross off the money and record the ship&#8217;s details on the Ship&#8217;s Manifest. The crew quality at the moment is poor.

		Each time you arrive at a new destination, remember to change the entry in the Docked column on the Ship&#8217;s Manifest. So, if you don&#8217;t intend to set sail right away, note that the ship is docked at Mukogawa.
