		After half an hour the disembodied heads of the three come drifting in out of the night. They all have purple juice dribbling down their chins and insects&#8217; legs stuck between their teeth.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Beetles again, yuk!&#8217; says the woman&#8217;s head, glaring in your direction. &#8216;Why can&#8217;t we have a succulent bite of human flesh for a change?&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Ssh!&#8217; says the chief head. &#8216;You&#8217;ll wake our guest. You know we daren&#8217;t harm someone with such powerful friends. They would send priests and wizards to exact revenge.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The heads attach themselves to their bodies and appear to sleep. The rest of the night passes uneventfully. You set out on your way before dawn, anxious to get far away from here.
