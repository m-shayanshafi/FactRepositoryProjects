		A bolt of lightning splits the boulder in two and the deity leaps forth. Dazzled by the blast, you cannot see him but you can hear his words: &#8216;You have given me the greatest of gifts, which is freedom. If death should ensnare you, I in my turn will set you free.&#8217;

		Write
		<resurrection book="6" section="710" supplemental="t">
			<i>Lords of the Rising Sun</i> <b>710</b>
		</resurrection>
		in the Resurrection Arrangements box on your Adventure Sheet. If and when you get killed, turn to <b>710</b> in this book. This is a special boon, which the deity grants even if you have another resurrection deal arranged. The deity departs. <goto section="44"/>.
