		One of the Akatsurese sailors, a man named Narakami, fancies himself as something of a poet. Gazing out to sea he says: &#8216;Under the wide sky, a scintillant refulgence: the lightning&#8217;s flicker. I see it and am fearful, then it fades and I am sad.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Belay that talk of lightning,&#8217; shouts the mate superstitiously, &#8216;or you&#8217;ll see me with my lash, and that&#8217;ll make you sad all right!&#8217;
