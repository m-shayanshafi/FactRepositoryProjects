	You go through to the outer royal apartments, where you spend
	a pleasant morning chatting with other courtiers. Servants bustle
	in with lunch, which consists of baked fish fresh from the Moku
	River, pickles, rice patties and iced sherbets. In the afternoon

	Later you take a bottle of rice wine and sit on the terrace
	exchanging poems until the moon sets.
