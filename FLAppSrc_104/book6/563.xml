		It is not easy to fight a foe you cannot see. Roll only one die for your COMBAT rolls in this fight, not two as you normally would.

		If you win, you can retrieve your light source and rekindle it. There is no sign of your assailant, just a tiny broken clay figurine on the floor. You had better retrace your steps and either leave the tomb (<goto section="583" force="f"/>) or try the other passage (<goto section="604"/>).
