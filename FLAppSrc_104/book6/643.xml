		The giant heaves his way up the stairs ahead of you. His wobbling bulk puts you in mind of two water buffaloes squeezed together in a sack full of dung - except that wouldn&#8217;t smell this bad.

		At last you reach the top storey, where the giant invites you to sit at his dining table. What you thought at first was a dirty lace tablecloth turns out to be a thick layer of dust that is thrown up into the air the moment you sit down. While you are coughing, the giant fetches a couple of rusty goblets, tips out the family of spiders who were living inside them, and pours you some wine.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Your health, sir giant,&#8217; you say for want of anything better.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Call me Big Boy,&#8217; he says, slobbering wine all down his chin.</p>
