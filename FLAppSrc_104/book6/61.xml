	You call on the gods to bear witness to this travesty of natural
	law: that a ghost should arise at once from the corpse of its
	former self and commence to wreak summary justice. The
	normal protocol allows for hauntings, nightmares and curses, but
	not this kind of brashness. Your prayer is that the gods will
	intervene to set matters aright.
