	<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s your funeral,&#8217; says the priest.</p>
	<p>
		You stomp off back to your bed of straw, determined to get a good night&#8217;s rest even if it really should turn out to be your last. You hear no more noise from the funeral procession, and in the morning you feel very far from dead. In fact you feel famished. Seeing a fox hanging around outside, you startle it with a loud cry. It bolts off into the trees, which seems to prove you are no ghost.
	</p>
	<p>
		You laugh at the fox&#8217;s fright, but also out of relief. What a strange experience.
