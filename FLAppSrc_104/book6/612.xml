<section name="612" dock="Chambara">
	Extensive quays enclosed by a broad sea wall comprise the
	dockland area of Chambara. Here you can set sail if you have a
	ship, or buy one if you do not. If you have neither a ship of
	your own nor the money to buy one, it is also possible to hire
	passage on a vessel bound for other ports.
