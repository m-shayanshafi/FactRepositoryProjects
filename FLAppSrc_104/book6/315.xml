	Karamochi, the chief of naval strategy, offers the following prices for second-hand ships:
	<market>
		<header type="shipsale"/>
		<trade ship="barque" sell="240"/>
		<trade ship="brigantine" sell="500"/>
		<trade ship="galleon" sell="900"/>
	</market>
	You cannot back out of the sale now that Karamochi has made an offer - you must sell him your ship. Cross it off the Ship&#8217;s Manifest, add the money to your Adventure Sheet, and <goto section="178"/>.
