		The Tao master takes out a fan and waves it at you. &#8216;You are beginning to irritate me,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Get you gone.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The first wave of the fan creates a breeze, the second brings a gale, and the third sends you sailing high into the air and over the treetops. Although you hold on tight to your possessions, 1-6 of them are torn away by the raging wind.
		(<random dice="1" var="x">Roll one die</random>;
		you decide
		<lose item="?" multiple="x">which possessions to lose</lose>.)
	</p>
	<p>At last the wind abates. <random/> to see where you land.</p>
