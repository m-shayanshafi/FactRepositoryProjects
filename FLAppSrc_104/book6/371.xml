		A monk comes to wake you. You are lying on a prayer mat in front of the effigy of the Sage of Peace. The silvery glimmer of departing night filters into the incense-filled haze.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;What is happening?&#8217; you ask, confused. &#8216;I can&#8217;t remember leaving the catacombs.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;You failed the tests,&#8217; replies the monk. &#8216;Come with me.&#8217;</p>
