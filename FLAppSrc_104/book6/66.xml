		The vampires hiss, snap and claw as you dodge between them. Their clumsy reflexes give you an idea. Swiftly tearing the <b>parchment</b> into strips (<lose item="parchment">cross it off</lose> your Adventure Sheet), you scribble mystic symbols and try to paste each strip on to a vampire&#8217;s forehead.
