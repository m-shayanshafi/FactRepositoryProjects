		It is characteristic of the people of Hagashin that they do not bother with the usual distinction between temples to the Sage of Peace and shrines to the divine powers. &#8216;All creation is divine,&#8217; says a priest, &#8216;so heaven and earth are one.&#8217;

			You can get a blessing for
			<lose shards="35" price="x"/>
		</if>
		<else>
			- or just
			<lose shards="20" price="x"/>
			if you&#8217;re an initiate of the Sage of Peace.
		</else>
		Blessings are available for
		<tick blessing="charisma" flag="x"/>,
		<tick blessing="scouting" flag="x"/>,
		<tick blessing="combat" flag="x"/> and
		<tick blessing="magic" flag="x"/>.
		Simply pay the money and note the appropriate ability in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet. The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you fail a roll for that ability. You can only use the blessing once; it is then used up and you should cross it off. Also, you can only have one blessing for each ability at any one time.
