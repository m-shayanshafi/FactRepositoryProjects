		The ghoul arrives at midnight but is undeterred by the benediction you spoke over the girl&#8217;s body. It climbs in through an open window and lopes on long thin legs over to the trestle where the body lies. You are watching from behind a door, and when you see the ghoul begin its grisly meal you know it is time to decide: will you step out and confront it, or slip away into the night?
