		The play is about a dragon, or <i>tatsu</i>, that threatens a land-holder as he is making his way across the mountains to visit his sick mother. The tatsu&#8217;s gaze is deadly, but luckily the land-holder has been given an iron fan by his wife before setting out and he uses it to shield his eyes.
