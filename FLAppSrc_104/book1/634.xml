		The climb is slightly easier than the last time, and you heave yourself over the lip of the top of Devil&#8217;s Peak. A gryphon - a creature that is half lion, half eagle, and at least the same size as you - has made its nest here. It immediately swoops in to the attack, intent on protecting its nest. You must fight.

		If you lose, you are birdfeed for gryphon chicks - your adventures are over.

			If you win, you find a <item name="bag of pearls"/> and <gain shards="10"/> in the nest. There is nothing else up here, so you slog all the way down again. <goto section="658"/>.
