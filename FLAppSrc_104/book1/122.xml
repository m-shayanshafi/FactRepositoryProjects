		Guildmaster Vernon of Yellowport is surprisingly eager to see you. He is a hugely fat and bejewelled merchant, and he tells you that a group of ratmen have made a base in the sewers beneath the city. They come out at night to raid the warehouses and homes of the merchants of Yellowport.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;We need an adventurer like yourself to destroy their king,&#8217; explains the guildmaster. &#8216;Without him, the ratmen wouldn&#8217;t be able to organize a feast in a larder. We will pay you 450 Shards if you succeed.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		Vernon tells you that the sewers can be entered via an old disused well in the poor quarter.
