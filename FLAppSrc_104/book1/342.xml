		The alchemist&#8217;s shop is lined with potions, jars of exotic substances, herbs, and so on. Alembics and beakers bubble and boil, full of strangely-coloured liquids. The alchemist, a tall, gangly fellow with a beak of a nose, sells potions. You can buy as many as you can afford - each one costs 50 Shards.
