	The village of Blessed Springs, nestling at the foot of a tall hill, has grown up around the holy waters, a special spring said to have healing powers. It has been fenced off by the villagers, and a priesthood appointed to supervise the supplicants who come to bathe, or drink of the spring&#8217;s waters. There is no market, but an alchemist has set up shop here.
