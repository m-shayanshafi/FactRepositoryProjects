		You follow the footprints to the mill, where you see an old lady and two men brushing flour off their clothes.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Another successful year&#8217;s haunting!&#8217; laughs the woman.</p>
	<p>

	</p>

		&#8216;Old Megan!&#8217; cries one of the villagers when he sees who is the ringleader of the three. &#8216;So, you&#8217;ve been masquerading as a ghost for these seven years, eh? Well, tomorrow we&#8217;ll take you to the gallows and then you can play the part for real.&#8217;
