		You are pious enough to be allowed to enter the sacred grove. You step in and knock on the door.
	</p>
	<p>A kindly old druid opens the door and greets you.</p>
	<p>
		You hand him the <lose item="oak staff"/> (cross it off your Adventure Sheet).
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Thank you!&#8217; says the druid, &#8216;An oak staff, eh! That&#8217;s an interesting message, to be sure.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		He hands you <gain shards="50"/> as payment and a <item name="willow staff"/>, saying, &#8216;Please take this staff to the Oak Druid in the City of Trees, on the Isle of Druids - I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll reward you, too. Good day, and thanks again!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>With that he shuts the door.</p>
	<p>You head back into the forest. <goto section="47"/>.</p>
