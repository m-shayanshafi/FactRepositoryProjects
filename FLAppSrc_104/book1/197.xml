	The blessing of Sig costs 10 Shards if you are an initiate, 30 Shards otherwise.
	<if shards="cost">
		If you buy the blessing,
		<group>
			<text>cross off the money and mark THIEVERY</text>
			<lose shards="cost"/>
			<gain blessing="thievery"/>
		</group>
		in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.
	</if>
	The blessing works by allowing you to reroll any failed THIEVERY attempt once. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You can then make a second try at the roll. You can have only one blessing for each ability at any one time. Once your THIEVERY blessing is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Sig to buy a new one. When you are finished here, <goto section="235">turn back to 235</goto>.
