	If you are an initiate it costs only 20 Shards to purchase the
	Three Fortunes&#8217; blessing. A non-initiate must pay 80 Shards.

		</group>
		in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.
	</if>
	The blessing works by allowing you to
reroll any dice result once. When you use the blessing, cross it
off your Adventure Sheet. You can have only one Luck blessing
at any one time. Once it is used up, you can return to any
branch of the temple of the Three Fortunes to buy a new one.
When you are finished here, <goto section="86"/>.
