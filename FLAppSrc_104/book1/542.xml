		&#8216;By Tyrnai! It&#8217;s the one who killed that pretender to the throne, Nergan Corin!&#8217; says one of them. They line up and give you a drunken salute, and then fall to slapping you on the back, and offering to buy you beers all night.

	<p>
		They also give you a present - a
		<item name="potion of strength">
			<effect type="use" ability="combat"/>
		</item>.
		Note it on your Adventure Sheet. When used it will add 1 to your COMBAT rating, for one COMBAT roll, or one fight only, after which it will wear off.
