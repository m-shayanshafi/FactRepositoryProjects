		You are brought before the druids&#8217; leader, the Oak Druid, a bearded fellow with earth and leaves all tangled up in his hair. He asks you to perform a service for them.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Take this oak staff to the Willow Druid in the forest of Larun. The sacred grove where he lives will be hard to find, but I&#8217;m sure you can do it. The Willow Druid will give you something to bring back to me. When you return with it, I will make you a better Wayfarer.&#8217;
