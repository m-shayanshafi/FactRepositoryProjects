		That night, your sleep is restless. You dream a most vivid dream. You are attacked by a gigantic sea monster, a mighty octopoid thing that encircles the ship with tree-like tentacles and pulls it under the waves. You sink into the bottle-green depths until you are caught in a glowing golden net.
	</p>
	<p>
		You wake in an undersea palace of multi-coloured coral, with mermaids to attend you. They lead you past trident-armed merman guards into a great hall. Seated upon two giant shells, like thrones, are the king and queen of the deep, with green hair, sea-grey eyes, and crowns of pale gold. Shoals of iridescent angel fish dart about in an intricate flashing dance of colour, dancing for the rulers of the land beneath the waves. In awe, you bow before them.

		The queen indicates that you should entertain them, for they are bored! A silver flute appears in your hands. <difficulty ability="charisma" level="11"/>.
