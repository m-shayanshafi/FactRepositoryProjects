		&#8216;It is fortunate we have a Chosen One of Maka at this temple,&#8217; says the high priestess. &#8216;Only the Chosen Ones have the goddess-given powers to cure the afflicted!&#8217;

		It costs 75 Shards - only 30 if you are an initiate of Maka - to be cured of a poison or a disease.
		<if shards="cost">
			Make any necessary payment and
			<group>
				<text>delete the disease or poison</text>
				<lose shards="cost"/>
				<lose disease="?"/>
			</group>, and its effects, from your Adventure Sheet.
