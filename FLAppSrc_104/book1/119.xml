		You hear the shouts from outside, muffled by the swirling sulphurous fog. A stab of icy panic pulses at your heart, and an instant later the door bursts open. Three militiamen armed with maces burst through the doorway. Behind them, a tall cadaverous gentleman wrapped in a cape is stamping in fury.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;A thief in my house!&#8217; he rages. &#8216;Do your duty!&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		You realise the truth: Lauria has used you as a decoy to cover her escape. You&#8217;ll get even later - if you survive.
	</p>
	<p>
		The militiamen race forward to seize you.
