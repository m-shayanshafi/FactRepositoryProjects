		You ask the innkeeper about Yanryt the Son. He looks at you oddly, clearly unsettled by your question.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Some say he is the son of a mortal woman, and the god Tyrnai. But he has not been here for some time&#8230;&#8217; Suddenly he stops, and stares in amazement at the corner of the tavern.
	</p>
	<p>
		You turn to look, and there, hunched over a stoop of ale, is Yanryt the Son. He greets you.
