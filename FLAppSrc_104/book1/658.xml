		You are standing at the bottom of the Devil&#8217;s Peak. It is a massive tower of black rock, like a stone tree-trunk, bare and branchless, climbing up into the sky. You cannot see the top, for it is shrouded in grey clouds. Thunder and lightning play about the clouded summit.
	</p>
	<p>
		The sides of the peak are almost sheer, but there are many hand and footholds. It can be climbed, but only if you have some <b>climbing gear</b>.
		<if item="climbing gear">
			If you have and you want to make the ascent, <goto section="340" force="f"/>.
		</if>
		Otherwise, <goto section="560"/>.
