	The shrine is set in a wooded grove. Birds twitter in the trees, and a deer darts away into the forest at you approach. A priestess is tending a low altar, where food and drink has been laid out in honour of Lacuna, the Goddess of the Wilderness. She is the patron of hunters, trappers, woodsmen, and all those who seek oneness with nature.
