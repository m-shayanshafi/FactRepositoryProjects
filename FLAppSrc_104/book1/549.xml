		The priestess, dressed in a cloak made entirely of the leaves of trees, with her face smeared with moss, greets you. &#8216;A tusk!&#8217; she exclaims. &#8216;But I have no need of another.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		You ask if she might need it for the next time. &#8216;Next time? Mmm, maybe you have a point.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		She offers you 15 Shards. If you accept,

			<tick shards="15"/>
			<lose item="boar's tusk"/>
		</group>. Either way, when you leave, <goto section="195"/>.
