		The city of Trefoille is a terrifying vision of apocalyptic destruction. It had once been a thriving crossroads town, but now it is a burnt-out hulk. It was almost razed to the ground when it declared for the late king, during the recent civil war, and tried to hold out against the army of Grieve Marlock, the current Protector-General of Sokara. It was then sacked by the general&#8217;s mercenaries, and General Marlock is now trying to rebuild it - craftsmen are hard at work everywhere.
