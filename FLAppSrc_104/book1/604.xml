		The men mutter among themselves at your decision, but you insist. The sea centaur lies barely able to move on the deck. Nor does it speak.

			</effect>
		</item>. When you blow it, it confers the blessing of Safety from Storms. It can be used three times only (each time you use it reduce the number of charges by one). When it is out of charges, it has become useless - cross it off your Adventure Sheet.
