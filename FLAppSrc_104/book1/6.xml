		The chest springs open with a click. Inside you find <gain shards="60"/>, a <tool name="mandolin" ability="charisma" bonus="1"/>, and a
		<item name="potion of healing">
			<effect type="use" uses="1" verb="Drink">
				<rest stamina="5"/>
			</effect>
		</item>.
		The potion can be used once, at any time (even in combat) to restore 5 Stamina points. There is also an ancient religious text about the gods of the Uttaku, called the <item name="scroll of Ebron"/>, which reveals that one of the gods of the Uttakin is called Ebron, and that he has fourteen angles.
