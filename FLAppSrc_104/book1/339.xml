		You find a burned-out house in the poor quarter where a trader has set up a stall, selling ash and debris. The merchant, a weaselly-looking old woman, is screeching, &#8216;Ashes, ashes from the house of a sorceress! Fifteen Shards a packet!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to buy some, cross off 15 Shards and
		<buy item="ashes" shards="15" quantity="1">note the <b>ashes</b></buy>
		on your Adventure Sheet. When you are ready, you head back to the centre of the town. <goto section="100"/>.
