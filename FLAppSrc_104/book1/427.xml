		Venefax is a strange-looking village. It looks like a single gigantic building. All the houses are joined together to form a jumbled mass, and none of the houses have doors - the only way in is through holes in the rooftop. Ladders lead up to the roof, which in effect forms a network of streets that the inhabitants travel across to get to certain buildings.

		&#8216;We had to build it that way, for defence,&#8217; says a passing farmer. &#8216;You see, the scorpion men from the south cannot climb, so they can&#8217;t get inside the town!&#8217;
