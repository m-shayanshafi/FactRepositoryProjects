		Gingerly, you open the door. It leads to a curtained alcove, through which you observe the room beyond. It is a long, low hall - clearly an ancient Uttakin temple, from a time when the Masked Lords of Uttaku ruled all of Harkuna, but now part of the sewers of Yellowport.

		A cheap wooden chair has been placed on the altar to act as a throne. On it sits a large and extremely ugly ratman. He has a tacky amulet around his neck, and a rusty iron hoop for a crown. About four ratmen are kneeling before him, engaged in conversation.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;But, Skabb...&#8217; one of the rat men is saying.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;That&#8217;s Great King Skabb to you, dung-breath!!&#8217; bellows the rat on the throne.
