		The high priest tells you that the <b>golden net</b> of the twin gods has been stolen. The repulsive ones have taken it to their palace beneath the sea in the Sunken City of Ziusudra. The repulsive ones worship the fish-god Oannes, who struggles with Alvir and Valmir for control of the sea.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;We must have that <b>golden net</b>, or the repulsive ones will use it against us. If you return it to us, we will reward you,&#8217; says the high priest. &#8216;The Sunken City lies under the coastal waters off the Shadar Tor.&#8217;
