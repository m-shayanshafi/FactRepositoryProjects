		You make your way up the hill. After a while, you spot a cave set into the hillside, a little further up. Judging by the human bones, dumped near the entrance, this is the lair of a dangerous beast. Fresh tracks, of some large, two-legged, threetoed creature, lead from the cave into some nearby trees. It seems it is not home, at the moment.
