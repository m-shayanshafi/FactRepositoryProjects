	<p>&#8216;What goes on here?&#8217; you ask. &#8216;Why do you behave so oddly?&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		The villagers seem quite frightened of you, but one old fellow has nerve enough to reply.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;This banquet is for the ghosts of three travellers who lost their way in a storm, fell into our millpond and were drowned.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;When was this?&#8217; you ask.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Seven years since. They come every year on this night, and if we didn&#8217;t placate them with victuals and treasure, there&#8217;d be a mess of trouble.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;How do you know that?&#8217;</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Old Megan told us,&#8217; he says. &#8216;She knows much about such things.&#8217;
