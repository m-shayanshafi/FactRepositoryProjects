		The priestess, dressed in silken robes, and wearing a wreath of oak leaves, says, &#8216;I have need of an adventurer like yourself. For arcane reasons involving the secret mysteries of Lacuna, I need the tusk of a boar. A were-boar, in fact. I believe they can be found in the Forest of the Forsaken, in northern Golnir. Hunt down a were-boar, and bring me a <b>boar&#8217;s tusk</b>. In return I will teach you how to be a better scout.&#8217;
