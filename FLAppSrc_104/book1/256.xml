		The king has another mission for you. He explains that an army of steppe Nomads, Trau, Mannekyn people, and Sokaran troops still loyal to Nergan, have gathered on the steppes, and are moving to siege the Citadel of Velis Corin, which guards the Pass of Eagles through the Spine of Harkun. Nergan tells you that an alliance of northern nations has declared war on the new Sokaran regime. A certain General Beladai leads the Northern Alliance, and King Nergan has joined forces with him. He asks you to travel to the Steppes and talk to General Beladai.

		&#8216;An adventurer like yourself might be able to steal into the citadel, and bring about its downfall from within, or some such. If the citadel falls we will have Sokara at our mercy.&#8217;
