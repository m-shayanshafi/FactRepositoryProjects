		&#8216;They&#8217;re vicious, evil devils,&#8217; says an old peasant. &#8216;Like huge scorpions they are, save they have the head and shoulders of a man - intelligent too, forever seeking to pillage our town, but they can&#8217;t climb up the ladders!&#8217;

		A soldier in the local militia speaks up, &#8216;They hate fire, too. All we have to do is sit atop the town, and pepper them with flaming arrows. They can&#8217;t stand that for long. Mind you, things are getting bad - they&#8217;ve got a sorcerer now!&#8217;

		A young man, blind in one eye and paralysed down one side, says, &#8216;They got a terrible sting as well - their venom did this to me,&#8217; pointing at his eye and side.
