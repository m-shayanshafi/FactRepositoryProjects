		A small boy runs up to you, saying &#8216;Help us, help us! The Man-eating Blood-Thursday Gob-gobbler has got my little sister!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>His mother, a flaxen-haired beauty, comes up behind him.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Surely, you mean blood-thirsty not Thursday,&#8217; you ask.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Oh no,&#8217; replies the young mother, &#8216;the Man-eating Blood-Thursday Gob-gobbler is so named because it hunts only on Thursdays!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The boy&#8217;s name is Mikail, and his mother is Lynn. Her husband is away in the army, and her young daughter, Haylie, was taken by the beast last Thursday. Apparently, several people have disappeared, never to be seen again.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Please, help us!&#8217; plead the villagers.</p>
