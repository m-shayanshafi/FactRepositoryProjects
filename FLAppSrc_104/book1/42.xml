		Two hulking shapes appear out of the shadows as if from nowhere. They are hideous creatures - manlike, standing on two legs, but with the tail and hairy features of a gigantic rat. Their yellowing teeth snap at you as they lunge for you; the ratmen also wield wicked-looking shortswords in their hands.

	<p>&#8216;Gut the human!&#8217; yells one of them in a bestial voice.</p>
	<p>
		You must fight them, both at once, as if they were one opponent.
