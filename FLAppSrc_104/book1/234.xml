		The ship&#8217;s captain says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take you to Dweomer, on the Sorcerer&#8217;s Isle but it&#8217;s a dangerous place. You&#8217;d better be sure you can handle it - if you&#8217;re not at least a Master of your profession, I&#8217;d advise against it. It&#8217;s up to you though.&#8217;

		You must have <i>Over the Blood-Dark Sea</i> to travel to Sorcerer&#8217;s Isle.
