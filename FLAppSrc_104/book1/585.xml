		You trail Fourze to the old farm. He goes inside, and you creep to see what he is doing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two rough-looking thugs are helping Fourze get into what is obviously a monster suit! It&#8217;s a bit like a giant hairy toad, made of the hide of some animal stretched over a wooden framework. So much for the dreaded Gob-gobbler!
	</p>
	<p>
		You wait by the door. As the thugs emerge, you club one to the ground, but you will have to fight the other one.

		If you lose, you are dead unless you have a <resurrection>resurrection deal</resurrection>.
