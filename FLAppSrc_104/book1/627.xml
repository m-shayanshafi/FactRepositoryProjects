	A bard in the tavern recites an epic tale of ancient legend. He
speaks of Xinoc the Priest King, the ruler of a mighty nation in
the distant steppes, far to the north. A thousand years ago his
empire flourished, and his wealth was enormous. He was buried
in a great pyramid tomb, along with his riches. It is said the
Pyramid of Xinoc lies beyond the Spine of Harkun, and beyond
the Great Steppes, in the foothills of the Peaks at the Edge of the
World. You question him further, but that is all he knows. You
leave the tavern. <goto section="10"/>.
