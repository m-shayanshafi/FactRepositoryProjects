		You come across a blazing house in the poorer area of town. A crowd has gathered, watching the flames impassively.
	</p>
	<p>
		A young girl runs up to you, in tears. &#8216;My mother is inside! Please, please help her!&#8217; she begs.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fire is raging hard, and you are not sure whether anyone could be left alive inside.
