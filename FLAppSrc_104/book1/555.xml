		All shipping in and out of Yellowport must come through the offices of the harbourmaster. Here you can buy passage to far lands, or even a ship of your own, to fill with cargo and crew.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can buy one-way passage on a ship to the following destinations:
	</p>
	<choices>
		<choice section="150" shards="10" pay="f">Marlock City, cost 10 Shards</choice>
		<choice section="301" shards="15" pay="f">Isle of the Druids, cost 15 Shards</choice>
		<choice section="234" shards="30" pay="f" revisit="t">Sorcerer&#8217;s Isle, cost 30 Shards</choice>
		<choice section="424" shards="30" pay="f" revisit="t">Copper Island, cost 30 Shards</choice>
	</choices>
	<p>
		If you buy a ship, you are the captain and can take it where you wish, exploring or trading. Three types of ship are available.
	</p>
	<market>
		<header type="ship"/>
		<trade ship="barque" buy="250" initialCrew="poor"/>
		<trade ship="brigantine" buy="450" initialCrew="poor"/>
		<trade ship="galleon" buy="900" initialCrew="poor"/>
	</market>
	<p>
		If you buy a ship, add it to the Ship&#8217;s Manifest, and name it as you wish. The quality of the ship&#8217;s crew is poor, unless you upgrade it. If you already own a ship you can sell it back to the harbourmaster at half the above prices. <i>[To sell a ship, use the following options:]</i>
	</p>
	<market>
		<header type="shipsale"/>
		<trade ship="barque" sell="125"/>
		<trade ship="brigantine" sell="225"/>
		<trade ship="galleon" sell="450"/>
	</market>
	<p>
		It costs <buy crew="average" shards="50"/> to upgrade a poor crew to average, and <buy crew="good" shards="100"/> to upgrade an average crew to good. Excellent quality is not available in Yellowport.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you own a ship, you can buy as many Cargo Units as it has room for. You may also sell cargo, if you have any. Prices are for single Cargo Units.
