		If you are an initiate it costs only 10 Shards to purchase Elnir&#8217;s blessing. A non-initiate must pay 25 Shards.
		<if shards="cost">
			<group>
				<text>Cross off the money and mark CHARISMA</text>
				<lose shards="cost"/>
				<tick blessing="charisma"/>
			</group>
			in the Blessings box on your Adventure Sheet.
		</if>
	</p>
	<p>
		The blessing works by allowing you to try again when you make a failed CHARISMA roll. It is only good for one reroll. When you use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. You can have only one CHARISMA blessing at any one time. Once it is used up, you can return to any branch of the temple of Elnir to buy a new one.
