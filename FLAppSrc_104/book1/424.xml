		The ship&#8217;s captain says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take you but you should be warned - it&#8217;s a dangerous place we&#8217;re travelling to. You&#8217;d better be sure you can handle it - if you&#8217;re not at least a master of your profession, I&#8217;d advise against. It&#8217;s up to you, though.&#8217;

		You must have <i>Over the Blood-Dark Sea</i> to travel to Copper Island.
