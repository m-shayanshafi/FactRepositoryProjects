		The heavy wooden gates of the temple of Tyrnai are guarded by couple of veteran warriors - the old iron bullmen are gone. Inside, the god is represented by a stone idol of a jaguar-headed warrior. He appears to be naked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly, a priest shouts, &#8216;It&#8217;s the thief! The blasphemous devil has had the nerve to return here!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
