		The trail of gruesome murders, and tales of terror leads you to an old cemetery in a near-deserted part of the old quarter. It is early morning, a few hours before dawn, so you haven&#8217;t much time before the ghoul goes into hiding.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the gates of the cemetery, you find a small girl, hunched over, sobbing. When she sees you, she backs away, terrified.
