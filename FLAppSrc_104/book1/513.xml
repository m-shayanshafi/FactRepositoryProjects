		One of them gives you a conch shell full of a greenish liquid. You drink it, and dive into the sea. Miraculously, you can breathe underwater! You follow the sea centaurs down into the depths until you arrive at a sunken ship, which is encrusted in barnacles and seaweed.

		Suddenly, the sea centaurs swim away, leaving you alone. You notice that you are giving off a glow like the sea centaurs. Looking down, you see that the lower half of your body has turned into that of a sea centaur! You have been taken and transformed to replace their lost companion.
