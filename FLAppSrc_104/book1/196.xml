		If you were wounded by the ghoul you have been infected with a disease (<disease name="Ghoulbite">
			<effect ability="sanctity" bonus="-1"/>
			<effect ability="combat" bonus="-1"/>
			<effect ability="charisma" bonus="-1"/>
		</disease>).
		Note that, until you can find a cure, you must subtract one from your SANCTITY, COMBAT and CHARISMA abilities (no ability can drop below one). If you were already suffering from Ghoulbite, there are no further effects.
	</if>
	In any case, you hack off the hideous head and leave. Note you have a <item name="ghoul's head"/> and <goto section="100"/>.
