		Becoming an initiate of Elnir gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services the temple can offer. It costs 60 Shards to become an initiate. You cannot become an initiate of Elnir if you are already an initiate of another temple.

				If you choose to become an initiate,
				<group>
					<text>write Elnir in the God box</text>
					<tick god="Elnir"/>
					<lose shards="60"/>
				</group>
				on your Adventure Sheet - and remember to cross off the 60 Shards.
