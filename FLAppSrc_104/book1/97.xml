		You climb down a narrow track to the beach. The sea pounds the rocky shore, and the spray lashes your face. A mournful, yet utterly captivating singing suddenly fills your ears. You look out to sea, and spot several mermaids and mermen, cavorting in the surf.

	<p>
		&#8216;Come, come to us...&#8217; one of them calls in a lilting voice that fills you with a yearning desire to plunge into the sea and swim out to them.
