		The temple of Tyrnai, the God of War, is built in the shape of a spear with a long, pillared nave, and an altar at the far end. Two massive stone warriors guard its gates.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tyrnai is depicted here as the insensate spirit of war - a blood-drenched warrior with the head of a maddened jaguar.
