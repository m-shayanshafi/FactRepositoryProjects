		The crew have been using a net to catch fish. This time they have caught a sea centaur, a strange-looking creature, with a top half like a man, and a bottom half like a sea horse. It struggles feebly, clutching at the net with webbed fingers, trying to saw it apart with a long, serrated dagger made of some sea shell.
