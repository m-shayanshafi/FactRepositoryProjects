		The little girl runs off before you can talk to her. You thread your way through the pitted tombstones and brooding crypts of the cemetery, under a pale moon that bathes the graveyard in a sickly, pallid light.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly, a foul stench fills your nostrils, and a figure rises up out of the shadows! Yellow eyes glow with feral blood-lust, and the creature sinks its black teeth into your arm before you can react. <lose stamina="4">Lose 4 Stamina</lose>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you still live, you have been infected. Note that you have a Disease
		(<disease name="Ghoulbite">
			<effect ability="sanctity" bonus="-1"/>
			<effect ability="combat" bonus="-1"/>
			<effect ability="charisma" bonus="-1"/>
		</disease>). Until you find a cure, you must subtract one from your SANCTITY, COMBAT, and CHARISMA abilities (no ability can drop below one). The ghoul, a rotting, walking corpse, lunges for you again.
