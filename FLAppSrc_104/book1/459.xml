	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Who are you, then?&#8217; it pipes in a squeaky voice.</p>
	<p>
		Just then, a palanquin, carried by four bearers, arrives. A man leans out and hails you, &#8216;You there! I&#8217;ve come to buy that flying monkey but I see I am too late. Nevertheless, I will give you 75 Shards for it.&#8217;

		&#8216;Don&#8217;t sell me to that popinjay - free me instead,&#8217; chitters the Mannekyn.
