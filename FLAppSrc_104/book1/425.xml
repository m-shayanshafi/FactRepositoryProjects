		The woman tells you her name is Lauria. She leads you stealthily through winding cobblestoned streets to a town house standing at the back of a small tree-lined square.
	</p>
	<p>
		A yellowish fog is descending with the coming of night. Lauria waits until it is thick enough to shroud your activities from any stray passersby, then jemmies a downstairs window. Within seconds the two of you are inside.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;You&#8217;ve got the easy job,&#8217; she says. &#8216;Stay down here and keep watch. The stuff we&#8217;re after is upstairs.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>She bounds silently up to the next floor.</p>
