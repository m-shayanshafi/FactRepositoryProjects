	You are walking through Bronze Hills. Virtually the whole area has been given over to mining. Everywhere, quarries and mineshafts abound. It is a horrible expanse of torn-up earth - hardly any areas of green are left. Great heaps of excavated rock, leeched of their useful minerals, mar the landscape. You find a quarry that is open to the public. That is to say, if you pay 50 Shards, you can dig for an hour in a silver mine.
