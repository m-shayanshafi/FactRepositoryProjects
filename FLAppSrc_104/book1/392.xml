		You pass your hands over the mad beggar, mumbling a prayer to the gods.
	</p>
	<p>
		The beggar cries out, &#8216;A cloud has been lifted from my mind! The curse is dispelled! I remember all!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		His name, he tells you, is Akradai, the Azure Prince of the Horde of the Thundering Skies, nomads of the steppes. &#8216;I was cursed with madness by Shazir of the Ruby Citadel but now you have cured me!&#8217; he says. &#8216;I am forever in your debt!&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		He leaves, with a parting cry, &#8216;Seek me on the steppes and I shall reward you.&#8217;
