		The temple of Alvir and Valmir, Divine Rulers of the House of the Sea, is right on the teeming harbour of Marlock City. Its sea-green marbled porticos are draped in a hundred silver nets. Brother and sister, Alvir and Valmir rule below the waves. Alvir brings the souls of the drowned in his nets before his sister, Valmir, for judgement.

		A swaggering ship&#8217;s captain emerges from the temple, saying to you in passing, &#8216;Never, I mean never go to sea without paying your respects to the twin gods - unless ye want to sail through a world of storms!&#8217;
