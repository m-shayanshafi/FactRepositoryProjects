	Becoming an initiate of Alvir and Valmir gives you the benefit of paying less for blessings and other services the temple can offer. It costs 40 Shards to become an initiate. You cannot do this if you are already an initiate of another temple.
	<if safeAddGod="Alvir and Valmir"><if shards="40">
			If you choose to become an initiate,
			<group>
				<text>write Alvir and Valmir in the God box</text>
				<tick god="Alvir and Valmir"/>
				<lose shards="40"/>

			on your Adventure Sheet - and remember to cross off the 40 Shards.
