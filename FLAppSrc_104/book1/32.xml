	You head across the hot, dusty and sparsely vegetated land. Vultures circle overhead - presumably they think you&#8217;re going to die. You wander on, until you come to a ridge. Down below, in a shallow valley, is a great mound of earth. Scorpion men crawl in and out of the many burrows that riddle the earth. The number of scorpion men in the valley makes your heart quail; unless you have the codeword <i>Artefact</i>, the place is too deadly to enter.
	<if codeword="Artefact">
		If you have the codeword Artefact, <goto section="406"/>.

	Otherwise, <goto section="492"/>.
