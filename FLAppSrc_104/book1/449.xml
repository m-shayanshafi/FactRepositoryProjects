		You creep past a scorpion man guard, which is dozing at the entrance to one of the burrows. The stench inside the mound is foul - a kind of acrid, rotting vegetable smell. You head for the centre of the mound, past tunnels, rooms and egg chambers, avoiding the inhabitants by skulking in the shadows.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, you come to a room which is more like the laboratory of a sorcerer than a scorpion den - jars, alembics and scrolls lie all over the place. A scorpion man is at work at a desk. Unlike others of his kind, he wears rudimentary clothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly, what you took for a stuffed animal&#8217;s head, mounted on the wall, says, &#8216;There is an intruder, master.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>The scorpion man wheels around and charges straight at you!</p>
