		&#8216;Wait,&#8217; you cry, &#8216;I have seen the light! I wish to join your cult!&#8217;

		A short ceremony later - fortunately, the initiation does not involve any cannibalistic rites - and you are a full member of the Cult of Badogor. Write <gain title="Unspeakable Cultist"/> in the Titles and Honours box on your Adventure Sheet. You <lose ability="sanctity" amount="1">lose 1 point of SANCTITY permanently</lose> for joining such a vile cult.

		&#8216;Remember, never say his name! And don&#8217;t forget to bring us new recruits,&#8217; says the leader. &#8216;And some people for dinner!&#8217; adds the chef.
