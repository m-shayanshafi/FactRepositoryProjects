		A swaggering Sokaran captain marches on board with a complement of marines.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve paid your harbour duties,&#8217; he says.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Harbour duties! We&#8217;re in the middle of the sea!&#8217; you exclaim angrily.
	</p>
	<p>
		The captain smiles smugly at you. &#8216;You&#8217;d better cough up 50 Shards, or I&#8217;ll impound your ship and its cargo.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;But that&#8217;s no better than common piracy!&#8217; says your first mate, outraged.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;The duty will be 60 Shards now, for calling a captain in the Sokaran Imperial Navy a pirate!&#8217; he sneers.
	</p>
	<p>Several of his men burst into laughter.</p>
