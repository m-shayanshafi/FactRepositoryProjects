		To renounce the worship of Alvir and Valmir, you must pay 30 Shards in compensation to the priesthood. The priest says nothing, he just points to a mural on the wall. It depicts the story of a woman who left the temple - a storm destroyed her ship and she drowned, to spend eternity as a lost soul, cleaning the barnacles off the thrones of Alvir and Valmir.
