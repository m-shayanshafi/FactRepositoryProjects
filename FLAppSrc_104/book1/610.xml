		At nightfall, the market is kept open for a special sale. A cage with a steel floor is wheeled out. Inside is a dark, manlike shape. It seems to radiate shadows, for you can barely make it out.
	</p>
	<p>
		The slaver says, &#8216;A trau, ladies and gentlemen. Excellent miners, though they have to be chained with cold iron at all times.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		The price is 100 Shards.
