	The merchants&#8217; guild of Marlock City is a large, many-storeyed building of marble. Inside, many clerks and scribes are at work. Here you can bank your money for safekeeping, or invest it in guild enterprises in the hope of making a profit. A sign on the guildmaster&#8217;s door reads &#8216;Help wanted.&#8217;
