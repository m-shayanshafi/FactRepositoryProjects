	<p>The guildmaster, a tall gaunt man, welcomes you.</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;The guild, in Golnir and Sokara, is plagued by privateers on the high seas. Amcha One-eye is the worst of these lawless dogs - he has cost us thousands of Shards! Bring me the head of Amcha One-eye, and I will reward you! He and his cut-throat crew operate from the Unnumbered Isles - now called the Kingdom of the Reavers because of the pirates who have made their base there. The isles lie to the south.&#8217;
