		You tell them a story of tragic love between a merman and a human princess. The mer-folk are moved to shed briny tears, and one of them plants a languorous kiss on your lips.
	</p>
	<p>
		You find that you can indeed breathe underwater now. The mer-folk lead you into the depths, where they swim playfully around you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly, a hideous form looms out of the murk. It is like a giant squid, but it carries a spear in one of its many tentacles and wears rudimentary armour. Great black eyes shine with an implacable alien intelligence. The mer-folk dart away in fright, leaving you alone with the creature.
