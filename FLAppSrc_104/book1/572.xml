		You open the door on to a large dining hall and kitchen. About thirty ratmen are standing around, eating and drinking. Everything goes quiet as they turn to stare at you with their black beady eyes.
	</p>
	<p>&#8216;Er, I do have an invitation,&#8217; you stutter, holding up the note.</p>
	<p>&#8216;And we&#8217;d love to have you for dinner,&#8217; one of them snarls.</p>
	<p>
		Yelling noisily, they charge toward you. You have little choice but to turn and flee for your life! You race down the sewer tunnels, with the ratmen in hot pursuit.
