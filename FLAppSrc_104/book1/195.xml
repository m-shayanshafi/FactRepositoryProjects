		The Trading Post is a small village, set up here by enterprising settlers from the mainland. Its main export appears to be furs from the forest.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Mayor, a fat genial fellow, who greets you personally, insists that one day the Trading Post will be a thriving town. There is not a lot here yet, however: a small market, a quay, the settler&#8217;s houses, and a shrine to Lacuna the Huntress, goddess of nature.
