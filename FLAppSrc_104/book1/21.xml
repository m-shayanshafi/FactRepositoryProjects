		While making your way through the back streets of the poor quarter you are set upon a knife-wielding thug, who is intent of relieving you of your purse.

	<p>
		If you don&#8217;t want to fight him, you can try a
		<difficulty ability="charisma" level="8" force="f">
			CHARISMA roll at a Difficulty of 8
		</difficulty>
		to try to talk your way out of this unpleasant situation.
		<success>
			If you succeed, the thug leaves, confused by your rhetoric (<goto section="10"/> and choose again.)
		</success>
		Otherwise, you must fight him.
