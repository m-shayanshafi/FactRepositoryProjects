		A scorpion man scuttles out of the brush to confront you. It resembles a huge scorpion, but with a human head and torso. It holds a sword and shield in its human arms. The creature&#8217;s eyes blaze with an unearthly yellow light, and it scrabbles towards you with frightening speed, whipping its sting up and around at you. You must fight it.
