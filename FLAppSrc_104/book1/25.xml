		Captain Vorkung is impressed with your claims of loyalty to the rightful king. He decides you might be useful to their cause, and you are led, blindfolded, through a secret pass to a mountain stockade.

		&#8216;I have need of one such as you,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Yellowport groans under the yoke of Governor Marloes Marlock, the brother of General Grieve Marlock. If you can get into the palace at Yellowport and assassinate Marloes, I will be eternally grateful.&#8217;
