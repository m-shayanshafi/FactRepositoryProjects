		Caran Baru is a medium-sized town, that acts as a way-station between the citadel to the north, and the rich towns of the south. It is a garrison town; many supplies, arms, and soldiers move through Caran Baru on the north-south trail. Shops, temples, traders, and the like have sprung up here to serve the needs of the military. There is also a sizeable mining community, for the mines of Sokara lie in the Bronze Hills, just outside town, and a slave market where poor unfortunates, sold into slavery, are bought for work in the mines.
