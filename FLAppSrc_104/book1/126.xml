		You come across a strange sight. A man lies staked out on the ground, asleep. Blue energy crackles up and down his body, and a hefty-looking hammer, glowing red, is still attached to his belt. It is Sul Veneris, the one you have come to free.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you are about to lift the stakes, a whistling, keening blast of ferocious wind engulfs you. You are surrounded by whirling storm demons - vaguely man-shaped creatures of thunderous energy which try to sweep you into the air and off the edge of the peak.
	</p>
	<p>
		You try to recite the rituals of dismissal associated with such demons. <difficulty ability="sanctity" level="12"/>.
