		One day, a new slave is brought in to work beside you. Much to your astonishment, it is Lauria, the thief who left you in the lurch when you burgled a wizard&#8217;s house in Yellowport.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8216;Sorry about the last time,&#8217; she says, &#8216;Business - you know. Now&#8217;s my chance to make it up to you.&#8217;
	</p>
	<p>
		She explains that she has discovered an escape route. This time, she promises to set up a diversion while you make for a tunnel where a cave-in has left an opening to the outside. Lauria says she will meet you later.
