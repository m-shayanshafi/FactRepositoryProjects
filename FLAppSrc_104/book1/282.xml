		The Temple of Tyrnai, the God of Battle, Chaos and Strife, is built like a small fortress in one corner of the city, near the barracks. Its heavy wooden gates are flanked by iron statues of bull-headed men wielding clubs. The workmanship is uncannily life-like. Inside, the god is represented by a stone idol of a jaguar-headed warrior. A beautiful suit of gold chain mail adorns the idol.
