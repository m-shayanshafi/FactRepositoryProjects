		The last time you were here, you had only a few minutes to grab some loot. Desperately, you search around for the <b>magic chest</b> that Oliphard the Wizardly wanted you to get for him. You find it - note the <item name="magic chest"/> on your Adventure Sheet - but the sea dragon returns almost straight away, and you are forced to climb out of the hole in the roof without getting anything more, save for a pouch of <gain shards="50"/>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You crawl out on to the island in the middle of the lake and hitch a boat ride back to Cadmium. During the journey, you examine the <b>magic chest</b>, but it is guarded by great sorcery and is impossible to open.
