		To use an ability (COMBAT, THIEVERY, and so on), roll two dice
		and add your score in the ability. To succeed you must roll
		higher than the Difficulty of the task.
	</p>
	<p><i>
			Example: You want to calm down an angry innkeeper. This 
			requires a CHARISMA roll at a Difficulty of 10. Say
			you have a CHARISMA score of 6. This means that you
			would have to roll 5 or more on two dice to succeed.
	</i></p>
	<p>
		Fighting involves a series of COMBAT rolls. The Difficulty of
		the roll is equal to the opponent's Defence score.
		(Your Defence is equal to your Rank PLUS your armour bonus
		PLUS your COMBAT score). The amount you beat the Difficulty
		by is the number of Stamina points that your opponent loses.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's pretty much all you need to know. If you have any
		detailed queries, consult the full rules
		('Original Rules', under the Help menu).
